  <span class="tags">astronomy, stargazing</span>
  
</div>

<div class="post">
  <p>In my <a href="../sky/">previous post</a>, I wrote about my initial experiences with stargazing - primarily to demonstrate that stargazing can be fascinating without fancy equipment. After the initial naked eye experiences, I bought a telescope which magnified my experience significantly.</p>
<h2 id="the-telescope">The Telescope</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of a telescope (astronomical in this case), unlike popular belief, is not actually magnification. They actually are light collectors (think: burning a match with a converging lens). Because the aperture of our eye is very small (7mm at best), we don’t capture enough light to see faint stars. Telescopes (and Binoculars) can have much larger objectives (that face the object of interest) and hence more surface area where the photon can hit.</p>
<p>Buying a telescope (or anything?) on an impulse is a bad idea and needs careful research. There are multiple articles/guides (like <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-equipment/how-to-choose-a-telescope/">this one</a>) that talk about it. I’d recommend going through a lot of such articles while having a few direct gazing sessions. This may help you decide on what you’d prefer to see and hence the kind of optics to buy.</p>
<p>I personally enjoy seeing faint stars and deep sky objects (star clusters, galaxies, nebulae) instead of planets/moon. In particular, the objects that Charles Messier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects">catalogued</a>.</p>
<p>My telescope has a <strong>114mm</strong> aperture and <strong>900mm</strong> focal length. I have 3 kellner eyepieces of sizes (and magnifications) <strong>25mm (36x)</strong>, <strong>10mm (90x)</strong> and <strong>4mm (225x)</strong>. It has a <strong>6x24</strong> (i.e. 6x magnification and 24mm aperture) finder. To keep the weight (and price) at a minimum, I got a Altazimuth mount.</p>
<p>On the web, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000Y8C2Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=H3RLG5OMNQX6ZMOH">this scope</a> is similar to mine. But I’d actually recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DDW9UW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001DDW9UW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=U6A22R7IFLTDIBPQ.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DDW9UW">Orion XT6</a> for much better observations or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D12U1IK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00D12U1IK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=XUNVRD64WYTFUT6U">Orion StarBlast 4.5</a> for its portability.</p>
<h2 id="finding-things">Finding things</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_hopping#The_technique">Star hopping</a> is the technique that is conventionally used by armature astronomers. But instead of star charts, I have <a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>, with which I get precise details of much fainter stars. Once having pointed the scope to a bright star, I synchronize my path with Stellarium. Because I am comparing stars in sky to a star in telescope, it is possible for me to end up at the exact locations of a deep sky object even if I can’t discern it because of light pollution.</p>
<p>I’ll write more about this in a future post.</p>
<h2 id="orion-nebula">Orion Nebula</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula">Orion Nebula</a> is the brightest diffuse nebula in the sky and lies in the constellation Orion (which also hosts my favorite star, Betelgeuse). Although it looks nothing like the colourful and detailed photos on the internet. I see it as a fuzzy extended grey object, similar to <a href="http://messier.seds.org/Pics/History/m42m.jpg">Charles Messier’s sketch</a>. It is impressive, nevertheless. The four young stars in its heart are distinctly noticeable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Orion Nebula is an example of a stellar nursery where new stars are being born.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="open-star-clusters">Open star clusters</h2>
<p>Of all the deep sky objects, I find open star clusters the most exciting. I like to examine their finer details, matching each star with Stellarium’s rendering. From my notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_41">M41</a></strong>, in constellation Canis Major, was my first cluster and is fairly bright. I even sketched the star pattern on paper, which now stays on my table at work.</li>
<li><strong>M93</strong> in Puppis constellation. Fairly bright.</li>
<li><strong>M45</strong> (Pleiades) in Taurus. A cluster of very bright stars. The brightest few stars are visible even without and optical equipment.</li>
<li><strong>M47</strong> (bright) and <strong>M46 (very dim)</strong> in Puppis constellation.</li>
<li><strong>M35</strong> in Gemini and bright.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planets">Planets</h2>
<p>Planets are like stars but brighter and without the twinkling. With a telescope, a few more details may be seen.</p>
<p>The planet I have most observed is <strong>Jupiter</strong>. Initially, to my disappointment, I could only make out an extend bright white disk. Eventually, my skills improved (Jupiter moved toward opposition as well) and I could actually make out the colors and the stripes. By coincidence I even got to see the great red spot. Jupiter rotates about its axis very fast (8 hour days), and I never had actually planned a sighting.</p>
<p>Of all the planets, I was most interested in <strong>Saturn</strong>. Having straightened my expectations, I was not disappointed on first sight. The ring is indeed present and looks beautiful. I haven’t been able to see the Cassini’s division yet though.</p>
<p><strong>Mars</strong> is a red/orange disk with no other features visible (yet). I saw <strong>Venus</strong> only for a few minutes. Unlikely I’d be able to see <strong>Mercury</strong> from where I am.</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong> (although not a planet) can be seen in fine details. It is the only object which is bright enough to take photos of with my phone’s camera. But other than that, I find it uninteresting. Moreover, it obliterates my eye’s dark adjustment. Moonless nights are the best stargazing nights.</p>
<h2 id="nebulae-globular-clusters-and-galaxies">Nebulae, Globular clusters and Galaxies</h2>
<p>I don’t attempt to see these much. They tend to be faint and the city lights takes away the required contrast for their visibility. I can be sure of having looked at them though, based on the nearby star patterns that I verify. So, my eyes probably caught photons from these. From my notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M1</strong> (Crab nebula), supernova remnant in Taurus. I must have put 6+ hours overall in trying to see it. Infact, I remember much of the star patterns near the nebula. But, wouldn’t claim to have seen the nebula itself.</li>
<li><strong>M78</strong>, reflection nebula in Orion. Tried to see it in multiple sittings, enough to have the nearby star patterns memorized. Saw a very dark grey and fuzzy object, if at all.</li>
<li><strong>M43</strong>, nebula right beside Orion nebula. Not discernible.</li>
<li><strong>M53</strong>, a globular cluster in Coma Berenices, visible as a round grey object. Very dim, but noticeable.</li>
<li><strong>M68</strong> a globular cluster in Hydra. Could not clearly distinguish it.</li>
<li><strong>M104</strong> (Sombrero Galaxy), galaxy in Virgo. Just recently started seeing it. I did likely discern it though. The view should improve in the future sightings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limiting-magnitude">Limiting Magnitude</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In astronomy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_magnitude">limiting magnitude</a> is the faintest apparent magnitude of a celestial body that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.<br />
- Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find figuring out the limiting magnitude for my telescope interesting. Theoretically, I should be able to see stars up to an apparent magnitude (lower the better and functions on a logarithmic scale) of <strong>12.8</strong>, but I can’t actually. My skills, light pollution, quality of optics and the atmosphere bring this down significantly. The faintest stars I have seen, with significant effort, are roughly of magnitude <strong>11.2</strong>. Usually, I can conveniently see stars upto <strong>10</strong> and with a bit of effort (a second or so of concentration), <strong>10.5</strong>.</p>
<p>Because of how our eye are designed, moving it during observations and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averted_vision">averted vision</a> improves the ability to distinguish very low contrast objects.</p>
