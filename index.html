        <p>Some months ago I decided about the what my new <a href="http://j.mp/o043VH">computer’s configuration</a>
will be. It was a really powerful machine with all the latest
parts (they still are latest!). Its main strength was the new intel processor
architecture - <a href="http://j.mp/qbjSyR">Sandy Bridge</a>. I had ruled out laptops
considering the higer costs with lower configuration and absence of the Sandy
Bridge architecture.</p>

<p>But due to unavailablility of processor and motherboard in India, I had to wait
for a long time till I figured out how to get all the parts. While the wait, I
started doing a smart upgrade of my existing notebook. I got a new monitor,
keyboard (The generic stuff). The one unique thing that not many people try was
a <strong>Solid State Drive</strong> (glad I am enjoying one). About this time only I took
a look at the detailed configuration of my laptop and upgrade options. I was
surprised to see that the maximum resolution the machine served was upto
8192 x 8192. After the SSD and a memory upgrade I was surprised to see the
performance boost and thanks it was giving me back. I was having all the fun
using multiple screens and not caring if I left any programs open. So I decided
to not get any new machine at all and keep using my CQ40-144TU for a while till
I find something worth upgrading in the market.</p>

<p>Since the time when I first decided for a new machine and now, I saw that there
were a <em>lot</em> of notebooks availabe with the <em>2nd Generation Core i series</em>
(Sandy Bridge) processors and at compelling prices. So I started a new search
with queries: <strong>Intel HD Graphics 3000</strong> (Ensures Sandy Bridge arch. and no
power hungry graphics card), <strong>Core i5</strong> (Ensures hyper threading and more than
required processing power and <strong>Free DOS</strong> (Of Course! - I dont want to waste
such a nice notebook with windows). There are some notebooks which come out
as reasonable buys.</p>

<p>I ruled out Dell on the first go as it only seems like it that they allow you
to customize, but they don’t. If you want a simple machine without <a href="http://j.mp/o7Zb36">all the
useless</a> (it is subjective) stuffs like Online backup (If I
wanted one I would use a VPS , Windows (I can’t understand why force it!) or
replaceable covers (I am getting a computer not a doll to play with!). What I
want is a processor + motherboard with some notebook essentials with it. HP and
ThinkPads are the brands I am looking at now. They provide some business
notebooks which serve all my purposes.<br />
I’ll tell about the final machine which I bought in some newer post.</p>

<p>Still, I would always miss my old machine, which has always been there with me
for roughly 1.5 years. It is still doing pretty good (This post is written with
one only) and has more upgrade capabilities. It is well over <em>good enough</em> as a
general usage computer.</p>

        <p>After having marvellous summers, I was comming back to collage. It is a tiring
jounrney of total 30 hrs. First Jaipur-Howrah and then to Kharagpur from there.
I was happy as I had got my confirmed reservation: Seat 32 in B-1 (It is nearly
impossible to get a confirmed reservation in that train). The boarding time was
2 AM in the morning (or night?).</p>

<p>So I boarded the train and headed to my seat, only to find out it was already
occupied. <em>Mr. A</em> was sitting there. So we (my parents had comewith me to see me
of) asked Mr. A to move as this seat was reserved on my name (I had checked out
my name on the reservation chart already). He says “This is not my seat, I have
exchanged it with him (pointing to <em>Mr. B</em>)”. So on asking the same to Mr. B,
he also replied the same pointing to <em>Mr. X</em>  and finally, we found the
conflicting passanger. 5 - 6 people of the cabin had woken up from their sleeps
because of all the noise.</p>

<p>Mr. X had a ticket which said “B-1 32” over the same train number and the right
date of the month. Believe me about 4 -5 people checked the ticked, including
myself. Infact it had a signature of a TC denoting <em>verified</em>. This guy was
adament and refusing to talk. We contacted the current TC who also agreed that
it was my seat. He asked me to at least get the conflicting ticket as Mr. X
wasn’t comming down. Finally he also decided to accompany me with his ticket
mouthing bad words to the official. The ticket looked all OK to him too, before
his eyes went on the month. It was a ticket of the train’s next month journy!
The guy then silently unboarded with his stuff and maybe boarded a general
compartment. Everybody who had exchanged “his” seat came back to theirs. Almost
everybody from the cabin was awake now. And I got my seat on the train.</p>

<p>Maybe Mr. X didn’t know that he was travelling in the wrong month or he had
booked a wrong ticket (more probable) or he was thinking that he could fool
the system (I dont feel sorry for him at all if this were the truth).</p>

        <p>The django admin filter horizontal/vertical widgets are a really cool
replacement of the inconvenient and ugly default multiple select elements.</p>

<p><img src="http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h356/crodjer/Blog%20Posts/Selection_010.png" alt="Django admin filter used in auth" /></p>

<p><em>But how do I get these in my normal forms?</em><br />
This is how:</p>

<p>First create a django form with <code>ModelMultipleChoiceField</code> and <code>FilterSelectMultiple</code>
as widget. To get this to work you need to add some extra media files. Here
is the snipet:</p>

<p><em>forms.py</em></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">forms</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.admin.widgets</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FilteredSelectMultiple</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TagForm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">forms</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Form</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">forms</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ModelMultipleChoiceField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">queryset</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Tag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">(),</span>
                                          <span class="n">label</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Select tags&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
                                          <span class="n">required</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                          <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">FilteredSelectMultiple</span><span class="p">(</span>
                                                    <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;tags&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
                                                    <span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                                 <span class="p">))</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Media</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">css</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="s">&#39;all&#39;</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="s">&#39;admin/css/widgets.css&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                   <span class="s">&#39;css/uid-manage-form.css&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="n">js</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;/admin/jsi18n/&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Add form media and form in the template.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="django"><span class="x">&lt;!--HEAD --&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">form.media</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x" />
<span class="x">&lt;!--BODY--&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">form</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x" />
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This extra css fixes some layout problems</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nc">.selector</span><span class="p">{</span>

        <p>I just shifted my website to Jekyll static pages, from the completely
dynamic <em>django</em> based and database oriented <a href="http://old.rohanjain.in">old one</a>.
The factor which drove this decision: <strong>VIM</strong> period.</p>

<p>I did not put up much on the old site because I couldn’t post directly from
my offline editor to posts there. The functionalities that were present over
there were to much overkill and completely invisible to the public, so better
save the processing power required to render the content every time the
page is accessed.</p>

<p>After the setting up of this, I expect a considerable increase in my
blogging frequency.</p>
