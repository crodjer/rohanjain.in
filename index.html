        <p>I have always tried to stay away from PHP. Python has always been my language
of choice. But, recently I got to write a considerable amount of code in PHP,
for my current projects. They are based on a web framework called
<a href="http://codeigniter.com/">Codeigniter</a>. Being completely inexperienced in
writing production code with PHP, I did struggle with it a bit.</p>

<p>As a language PHP has its pros and cons. This post includes my personal
opinions so, tagged as &lsquo;subjective&rsquo;.</p>

<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>

<h2 id="comprehensive-documentation">Comprehensive documentation</h2>
<p>PHP has a really high adoption, so has a rather comprehensive amount of
resources available over the web. If you run into some issue, you can mostly be
sure that some else has had the same issue as well proceed as that person did.</p>

<h2 id="c-like-syntax">C like syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax is not much alien to C, which is a language most of the programmers
know from their &ldquo;Programming 101&rdquo;s. So the initial slope of the learning curve
is not steep.</p>

<h2 id="lots-of-libraries">Lots of libraries</h2>
<p>Want to implement something? There is probably an existing library which does
that for me. Hence, you can save yourself from writing lots of code. Infact for
any new web technology PHP is always amongst the languages which get a
library first.</p>

<h2 id="common-web-development-language">Common web development language</h2>
<p>If one is assembling a team, it is probably true that PHP developers will be
the easiest to find. So one could just choose PHP as the language.</p>

<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
<p>With PHP 5.3 and up, anonymous functions are available. These are very useful,
particularly in array maps and callbacks.</p>

<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>

<h2 id="the--operator">The <code>||</code> operator</h2>
<p>The results from the or (<code>||</code>) should be one of the operands instead it returns
<code>1</code> or <code>0</code> which is useless most of the time.</p>

<h2 id="error-reporting">Error reporting</h2>
<p>Lot of errors that occur while execution, just fail silently or with warnings
and the execution continues. Why not just halt the script execution and let
the programmers deal with it, they can take it.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-no-promises">There are no promises</h2>
<p>You cannot promise PHP that <code>foo</code> will return an array, so it is not possible
to just do <code>foo(arg)['key']</code> to get a particular index of the array resulting
from the function call.  Instead a temporary variable, <code>$foo_result</code> is needed.
Because of this you can&rsquo;t chain function calls to apply multiple functions
over a variable. This is particularly annoying with arrays, while doing various
manipulations over them.</p>

<h2 id="embedding-code-in-html">Embedding code in HTML</h2>
<p>Some might say that this is a good thing, but I don&rsquo;t believe so. This doesn&rsquo;t
let you decouple the templates from the application back end. Templates get
too much power and projects end up with some application logic in templates.</p>

<h2 id="lots-of-libraries-1">Lots of libraries</h2>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this a pro too? It was but this also has some negative effect. There
are multiple libraries available, sometimes for doing the same task. They
don&rsquo;t have wide contexts. Each might fulfill functionality that one requires
partially but not all.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>PHP is definitely a major server side scripting language. Its popularity, the
ease to build developer teams counts as a reason for choosing PHP. But, given
a choice, PHP will always be on the lower side of my priority list. I&rsquo;ll
mostly go with full fledged languages like Python. With
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>
around, server side Javascript also looks promising. To get around their
limitations they can always be used in parallel with other systems.
Its better to have multiple decoupled systems, providing reasonable APIs and
implemented in a technology best for each of them, talk to each other instead
of writing everything down in the same language.</p>

        <p>Some time ago, I <a href="/personal/2011/08/11/what-i-learnt-about-buying-computers/">wrote about my search</a>
for a notebook, which does exactly what I need it to. It is an <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/computers/laptops/hp/itmczxzyhgkabvgp">HP 630
Essential Business PC</a>.
The price is very much reasonable for the hardware it has and the useless stuff
(some windows pre-installations, replaceable lid covers, graphic card etc.) it
does not.</p>

<p>Actually, I had bought it some time ago but didn&rsquo;t write about it earlier as I
was waiting for its configuration to be complete so that it can be titled
<strong>awesome</strong> (as was my old one). Now that it has a 6 Gigs of RAM and a fast OCz
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">SSD</a> my hardware upgrade is
finally complete so that I could brag about it.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/">debian sid</a> installation with <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome
wm</a> (not directly related to the machine&rsquo;s title)
and linux 3.0 is working pretty nicely. I have made sure that each and every
hardware works. The processor turbo boosts up to 2.9 GHz when GCC asks to,
graphics are pretty good and nothing makes any sound at all (the SSD adds to
the fact). To my surprise the touchpad turned out to be really great. Although
I had already given up the mouse, the pad makes sure that whenever the tragic
need of moving the mouse cursor comes (sometimes with chrome) it&rsquo;ll ease it up.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact about my configuration is the Standing Table (yeah I
don&rsquo;t sit while working). This is how the whole setup looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h356/crodjer/Blog%20Posts/Standing%20Table/Image0123.jpg" alt="Standing Table" />
<img src="http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h356/crodjer/Blog%20Posts/Standing%20Table/Image0124.jpg" alt="Standing Table Under Focus" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>I have switched back to a left right configuration again. The experience of
stating table was nice, but wasn&rsquo;t sustainable for I was experiencing issues
of space management.</p>

        <p>Recently I opened up on the port <em>443</em> over my EC2 instance (more or less like
a VPS), so that I can access it through any firewalled proxy too. Apart from
getting SSH running to a machine from outside world, I did some cool
configuration to have ssh deal with with various remote hosts automatically. It
uses <em>the right</em> proxy settings according the host being accessed.</p>

<p>All the stuff which runs over ssh (like <em>scp</em>, <em>git</em> etc.) also work the way
they are supposed to, following the ssh configuration.</p>

<p>To get this to work you need to have <em>corkscrew</em> and <em>netcat</em> (the swiss army
knife) already installed.</p>

<p>Here is how it goes:<br />
<code>File ~/ssh/config:</code></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="c"># Let me access local remotes directly.</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> <span class="m">127.0.0.1</span>, <span class="m">10</span>.*
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> <span class="k">none</span>

<span class="c"># Github lets you ssh over port 443 too, utilize that instead of tunneling</span>
<span class="c"># through remote computer</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> github.com

    <span class="nb">User</span> git

    <span class="nb">Port</span> <span class="m">443</span>
    <span class="nb">Hostname</span> ssh.github.com

<span class="c"># Let me ssh onto my ec2 instance, which has full network access, through a</span>
<span class="c"># http proxy.</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> ecc.rohanjain.in
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> corkscrew <span class="m">10.3.100.211</span> <span class="m">8080</span> %h %p
    <span class="nb">Port</span> <span class="m">443</span>
    <span class="nb">ServerAliveInterval</span> <span class="m">600</span>

<span class="c"># All the rest should connect through an ssh connection over the ec2 instance.</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> *
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> ssh -q -a -x -p <span class="m">443</span> ecc.rohanjain.in nc %h %p
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
As brought out by yeban (<a href="http://yeban.in/seamlessly-use-github-behind-http-proxy-on-port-443.html">http://yeban.in/seamlessly-use-github-behind-http-proxy-on-port-443.html</a>),
use github&rsquo;s 443 ssh host for accessing github.</p>

        <p>As far as listening to music is concerned, I have always been relying on the
various radio broadcasters. I do not invest much time in maintaining a music
collection.</p>

<p>But this solution did not work at Kharagpur. There is no good radio station
available over here, at least for listening to Hindi music. I then turned
to the various online radio services, which seemed to work out pretty nice.
Now all I needed a good interface to control the radio. The Rhythmbox interface
and that of some other radio clients from the Debian repository did not look
friendly (chuck the mouse and then test them). Here comes the mplayer to the
rescue, which I am using currently.</p>

<p>I also created this shell script which stores the channels as key value pairs
and invokes mplayer with correct proxy settings.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
