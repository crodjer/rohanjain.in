        <p>Some time ago, I <a href="/personal/2011/08/11/what-i-learnt-about-buying-computers/">wrote about my search</a>
for a notebook, which does exactly what I need it to. It is an <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/computers/laptops/hp/itmczxzyhgkabvgp">HP 630
Essential Business PC</a>.
The price is very much reasonable for the hardware it has and the useless stuff
(some windows pre-installations, replaceable lid covers, graphic card etc.) it
does not.</p>

<p>Actually, I had bought it some time ago but didn&rsquo;t write about it earlier as I
was waiting for its configuration to be complete so that it can be titled
<strong>awesome</strong> (as was my old one). Now that it has a 6 Gigs of RAM and a fast OCz
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">SSD</a> my hardware upgrade is
finally complete so that I could brag about it.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/">debian sid</a> installation with <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome
wm</a> (not directly related to the machine&rsquo;s title)
and linux 3.0 is working pretty nicely. I have made sure that each and every
hardware works. The processor turbo boosts up to 2.9 GHz when GCC asks to,
graphics are pretty good and nothing makes any sound at all (the SSD adds to
the fact). To my surprise the touchpad turned out to be really great. Although
I had already given up the mouse, the pad makes sure that whenever the tragic
need of moving the mouse cursor comes (sometimes with chrome) it&rsquo;ll ease it up.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact about my configuration is the Standing Table (yeah I
don&rsquo;t sit while working). This is how the whole setup looks like:</p>

        <p>Recently I opened up on the port <em>443</em> over my EC2 instance (more or less like
a VPS), so that I can access it through any firewalled proxy too. Apart from
getting SSH running to a machine from outside world, I did some cool
configuration to have ssh deal with with various remote hosts automatically. It
uses <em>the right</em> proxy settings according the host being accessed.</p>

<p>All the stuff which runs over ssh (like <em>scp</em>, <em>git</em> etc.) also work the way
they are supposed to, following the ssh configuration.</p>

<p>To get this to work you need to have <em>corkscrew</em> and <em>netcat</em> (the swiss army
knife) already installed.</p>

<p>Here is how it goes:<br />
<code>File ~/ssh/config:</code></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="c"># Let me access local remotes directly.</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> <span class="m">127.0.0.1</span>, <span class="m">10</span>.*
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> <span class="k">none</span>

<span class="c"># Github lets you ssh over port 443 too, utilize that instead of tunneling</span>
<span class="c"># through remote computer</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> github.com
    <span class="nb">Hostname</span> ssh.github.com
    <span class="nb">User</span> git
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> corkscrew <span class="m">10.3.100.211</span> <span class="m">8080</span> %h %p
    <span class="nb">Port</span> <span class="m">443</span>
    <span class="nb">Hostname</span> ssh.github.com

<span class="c"># Let me ssh onto my ec2 instance, which has full network access, through a</span>
<span class="c"># http proxy.</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> ecc.rohanjain.in
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> corkscrew <span class="m">10.3.100.211</span> <span class="m">8080</span> %h %p
    <span class="nb">Port</span> <span class="m">443</span>
    <span class="nb">ServerAliveInterval</span> <span class="m">600</span>

<span class="c"># All the rest should connect through an ssh connection over the ec2 instance.</span>
<span class="nb">Host</span> *
    <span class="nb">ProxyCommand</span> ssh -q -a -x -p <span class="m">443</span> ecc.rohanjain.in nc %h %p
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
As brought out by yeban (<a href="http://yeban.in/seamlessly-use-github-behind-http-proxy-on-port-443.html">http://yeban.in/seamlessly-use-github-behind-http-proxy-on-port-443.html</a>),
use github&rsquo;s 443 ssh host for accessing github.</p>

        <p>As far as listening to music is concerned, I have always been relying on the
various radio broadcasters. I do not invest much time in maintaining a music
collection.</p>

<p>But this solution did not work at Kharagpur. There is no good radio station
available over here, at least for listening to Hindi music. I then turned
to the various online radio services, which seemed to work out pretty nice.
Now all I needed a good interface to control the radio. The Rhythmbox interface
and that of some other radio clients from the Debian repository did not look
friendly (chuck the mouse and then test them). Here comes the mplayer to the
rescue, which I am using currently.</p>

<p>I also created this shell script which stores the channels as key value pairs
and invokes mplayer with correct proxy settings.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

    <div class='post-text'>
        
        <p>Some months ago I decided about the what my new <a href="http://j.mp/o043VH">computer&rsquo;s configuration</a>
will be. It was a really powerful machine with all the latest
parts (they still are latest!). Its main strength was the new intel processor
architecture - <a href="http://j.mp/qbjSyR">Sandy Bridge</a>. I had ruled out laptops
considering the higer costs with lower configuration and absence of the Sandy
Bridge architecture.</p>

<p>But due to unavailablility of processor and motherboard in India, I had to wait
for a long time till I figured out how to get all the parts. While the wait, I
started doing a smart upgrade of my existing notebook. I got a new monitor,
keyboard (The generic stuff). The one unique thing that not many people try was
a <strong>Solid State Drive</strong> (glad I am enjoying one). About this time only I took
a look at the detailed configuration of my laptop and upgrade options. I was
surprised to see that the maximum resolution the machine served was upto
8192 x 8192. After the SSD and a memory upgrade I was surprised to see the
performance boost and thanks it was giving me back. I was having all the fun
using multiple screens and not caring if I left any programs open. So I decided
to not get any new machine at all and keep using my CQ40-144TU for a while till
I find something worth upgrading in the market.</p>

<p>Since the time when I first decided for a new machine and now, I saw that there
were a <em>lot</em> of notebooks availabe with the <em>2nd Generation Core i series</em>
(Sandy Bridge) processors and at compelling prices. So I started a new search
with queries: <strong>Intel HD Graphics 3000</strong> (Ensures Sandy Bridge arch. and no
power hungry graphics card), <strong>Core i5</strong> (Ensures hyper threading and more than
required processing power) and <strong>Free DOS</strong> (Of Course! - I dont want to waste
such a nice notebook with windows). There are some notebooks which come out
as reasonable buys.</p>

<p>I ruled out Dell on the first go as it only seems like it that they allow you
to customize, but they don&rsquo;t. If you want a simple machine without <a href="http://j.mp/o7Zb36">all the
useless</a> (it is subjective) stuffs like Online backup (If I
wanted one I would use a VPS , Windows (I can&rsquo;t understand why force it!) or
replaceable covers (I am getting a computer not a doll to play with!). What I
want is a processor + motherboard with some notebook essentials with it. HP and
ThinkPads are the brands I am looking at now. They provide some business
notebooks which serve all my purposes.<br />
I&rsquo;ll tell about the final machine which I bought in some newer post.</p>

<p>Still, I would always miss my old machine, which has always been there with me
for roughly 1.5 years. It is still doing pretty good (This post is written with
one only) and has more upgrade capabilities. It is well over <em>good enough</em> as a
general usage computer.</p>
