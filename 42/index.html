The mind is free, with not much to worry about and starts to wander. It lands on
the question: &ldquo;What is the meaning of it all?&rdquo;.

sets in an existential crisis.
But, I&rsquo;d argue that there is a flaw in the question. Meaning isn&rsquo;t something one
should try to look for at all. Maybe, purpose is the right quest. And if you try

Statistically speaking, that makes sense. There are usually many more possible
configuration for (what we call) disorder than (what we call) order. So, things
naturally tend toward disorder and seemingly, destruction.</p><p>Life, on the other hand, behaves strangely. It has somehow figured out a way to,
in a limited sense, continue order. Organisms are able to replicate very
unlikely combinations of chemicals over and over again. Going at a macro level
and thinking in an anthropocentric way, that is what humans seem to do as well -
build complex structures and ideas which would be fairly unlikely to just
randomly show up naturally otherwise.</p><p>And this is what can be taken as the <strong>purpose</strong>. To revolt against nature,
fight against destruction, defy the rise of entropy. Life&rsquo;s been trying to
attempt bringing some predictability and organisation (at one level anyway) to
the world. This experiment was most likely started ~4.5 billion years on Earth.
Lets try to prolong it - just for the sake of curiosity if not anything else.</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/blog>Back to posts</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class=icons><div class=container><div class=content><a href=//github.com/crodjer target=_blank rel=noopener>Github</a>
