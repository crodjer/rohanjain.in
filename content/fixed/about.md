Hi, I am Rohan. I read and write code. I frequently read about physics, energy
and climate change. After getting depressed enough of the latter, I read fiction
or annoy my friends with my ideas or just code.

I like to play table tennis, cricket and chess. I also bought a harmonica. Keep
your hands on ears if you see me holding it. And yeah, I maintain a blog, which
is so devoid of activity that it should have cobwebs on
it.

On the days with clear skies, I take out my telescope and observe star clusters
and nebulae. I am trying to go through the Messier catalog.
