[tl;dr](#tl-dr)


We love dark backgrounds. They are easier on the eyes, comfortable to
use in the dark. Comfortable to work with in the night/dark rooms. So,
we'd like **everything** that we see on the screen to be dark. And that's
the key, _everything_ must be dark.

Imagine working on the computer with a completely dark environment.
Every app configured to be at its darkest. You find the need to look
something up on the web. No worries, the search engine supports dark
mode, so that's good. Hey, the 2nd search result _is_ what you were
looking for and you open it. Then, an extreme bright light hits you
hard. The article is built with a white background, in a way that all
your hacks to make (_most_) websites dark doesn't work. The eyes hurt,
the head hurts a bit.

You feel annoyed. You want to let the website developer know what they
did to you. How they derailed your mind while working. But is it their
fault? In fact, they just helped you out solve a problem you were
facing.

I have faced this. Multiple times, a long long time back. Why a long
time back? Because at one point, I realize that we aren't ready for
the darkness and switched all applications to be light.

Now, I can happily browse around the web without the worry that
something I visit may accidentally just hit my eyes. I am extremely
sensitive to bright light. So much so that almost everyone near me
finds it hard to see any of my screens. In fact, I make everything
_matte_, even my phone screen, at a cost of display quality just to
reduce the glare.

I love the dark background. I hope at some point it becomes the
default everywhere. But for now, light backgrounds the default.
Users should be able to tell the browsers their dark/light mode
preference, which can then be forwarded to websites - just like time
zone information is.

Interestingly, light backgrounds with extremely low brightness
settings, save energy in LCD displays.

But Solarized light is great too!_
