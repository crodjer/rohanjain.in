I have this internship of mine in which I am supposed to develop web applications using the Merb framework. So, how do I go about it? Isn't it simple? Install the 'gems', read the 'documentation', and start writing the 'code'. Aah.. if only the Merb community had been so kind and taken the pains to document their work. "Incredulous, ain't you?" Go to their web-site and check it out for yourself. Oh yes, they have some shit output by a program called 'rdoc' under their API section, which they proudly hail as documentation. Its good for nothing. At least not for the beginners. And especially not if you have migrated from the comforts of <span style="font-style: italic;">a very properly documented</span>, Django(its written in Python) framework. "I love you, Django guys."<br />Again, I have this other job of writing tests. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> has taken over the Ruby community like a storm. The crux is that the tool 'rspec' comes with no proper documentation. If you are moron enough to be unable to guess yet, 'rspec' is the tool meant to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> in Ruby/Merb. Poor me. :P<br /><br />Well I won't just rant about the laziness of the Ruby community, rather I am providing here some links which proved helpful to me. Maybe it helps you out as well.<br /><br /><ol><li><a href="http://book.merbist.com/">The Merb Open Source Book</a>- It is the Djangobook counterpart for Merb, only it is still incomplete. You are most welcome to contribute to it.</li><li><a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/documentation/guides">Notes from their wiki</a>- They have a bit of good notes about the framework.</li><li><a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/howto/gettingstarted/firstapp">Your first Merb App</a>- Won't help much if you are not already aware of what it does.</li></ol><br />Another thing is learning the TDD. You simply cannot do anything without reading at least one of these two:-<br /><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-rspec/"><br /></a><ol><li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-rspec/">Behaviour Driven Development</a>- A tutorial by IBM</li><li><a href="http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/blog/developing-a-rails-model-using-bdd-and-rspec-part-1.html">By Luke Redpath</a></li></ol><br />P.S: If you want to learn Ruby, do not go for anything other than <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/">The Pragmatic Programmers Guide</a>
