Ruby and Google Summer of Code. Pure fun. My job is to add NeXML parsing and serializing support, and an RDF triples API to <a href="http://bioruby.org/">BioRuby</a>.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/NeXML">NeXML</a> is a file format, based on XML, to express Phylogenetic data. Phylogenetics is the study of <span style="font-style: italic;">evolutionary relatedness</span> among various groups of organisms. Evolution is a branching process wherein a new species evolves from the existing populace. Evolutionary relatedness between such species can be studied by DNA sequence analysis( and some other methods ). This can be visualized as a tree, the phylogenetic tree. Naturally, phylogenetic data will involve working with a set of species, a tree to depict their evolutionary relatedness and how such relations have been inferred.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>( or, Resource Description Framework ) is a meta data model. Conceptually, you use RDF to assert relation between, a subject and an object using a predicate. Say, the colour of my car is black. RDF breaks the previous assertion into (subject, predicate, object) => (car, color, black), also called <span style="font-style: italic;">triples</span>. Phylogenetic database by nature is huge and complex. To find the relevant information efficiently, it is necessary to index phylogenetic data with descriptive information( or, meta data ).<br /><br />The project has been offered under <a href="http://www.nescent.org/index.php">National Evolutionary Synthesis Center</a>( NESCENT ). I will be mentored by <a href="http://rutgervos.blogspot.com/">Dr. Rutger Vos</a> (primary), and <a href="http://saaientist.blogspot.com/">Dr. Jan Aerts</a>.<br /><br />Coding starts from 24th May. Interested souls might find the "phylosoc" label on this blog and the project wiki[1] interesting.<br /><br />Links:-<br /><ol><li><a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Category:NeXML_and_RDF_API_for_BioRuby">Project Wiki</a></li><li><a href="http://github.com/yeban/bioruby">Source Code</a><br /></li><li>Other accepted projects from <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2010#Accepted_Projects">NESCENT</a><br /></li></ol>
