For my assignment I had to implement the basic image morphology algorithms: Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing, Hit and Miss Transform, Hole Filling, Thinning, Thickening, Pruning, Skeletonizing, Boundary Extraction and Connected Components in C++ using the OpenCV library.<br /><br />Theory of Image Dilation and Erosion (as well as for other algorithms) can be found <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/index.htmhttp://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/index.htm">here</a>.<br /><br />I have put here the code for Image Dilation and Erosion. I will put up the complete code on github soon.<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/215204.js"></script><br /><br />I have represented the kernel using an IplImage structure. The code above is for Dilation. For Erosion all you need to do is replace <code>max_element</code> with <code>min_element</code> in line number 40. <br /><br />P.S: The use of vectors and algorithms is not "entirely" justified except that I am used to dynamic languages like Ruby and Python :P.
