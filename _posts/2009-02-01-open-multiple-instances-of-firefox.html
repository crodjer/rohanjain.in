<div class="snap_preview"><p>Technically not very correct but, a workaround is to create several profiles. Every profile in firefox has its own preferences and memory allocation (i.e. cookies, password, history). The following applies to Firefox on Linux. I have especially tried it on Debian with Iceweasel installed (my system obviously), but it should work for all distros as well.</p> <p> <ol><li>1.Open the terminal and type in:<br /><code>firefox -ProfileManager</code><br />this opens Profile Manager of Firefox, where you can create a new profile or rename or delete an exsting profile. A profile named “default” will be pre-existent.</li><li>2.Create a new profile, select it and click “Start Firefox”. Configure all your settings.</li><li>3.Again whenever you want to start Firefox with the new profile you created type the following in the terminal:<br /><code>firefox</code> -P (profile name) , without the parentheses</li></ol></p> <p>Debian users can replace “firefox” with “iceweasel” wherever you need to type-in the commands, but “firefox” will work equally well.</p></div>
