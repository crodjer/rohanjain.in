A bad start of the week. Bunked all the classes on Monday and yet did nothing. A bit of twittering, a little Django, and then planning, what to do the next day. I hate being unproductive. A very bad pain in the ear kept me unproductively awake till 3 am. Tuesday. I wasn't prepared for my viva on Physic's practical. Luckily!the choice of giving a viva is vested in the students. Again, I couldn't complete the Forced Oscillation experiment. Finally a PDS lab in the afternoon. Ah! Damn me! I wrote a bad merge sort algorithm. Spent the evening debugging C programs for my friend and teaching them (today is PDS test). Preparing for a submission in Mechanics took the rest part of the night. And now (Wednesday morning), i am writing this post. Today the only good thing to look forward to is, the Artagnon meet.<br /><br />Well, good night world. And, best of luck to me.
