I use <a href="http://slim.berlios.de/">SLiM</a> (Simple Login Manager) as my login manager, which is highly customizable, light and simple as its name suggests. Installing SLiM on Debian/Ubuntu simple as <code>sudo apt-get install slim</code><br /><br />Here is a screenshot of the theme I created.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/SivcmcyC15I/AAAAAAAAAFE/o8woMq27oIg/s1600-h/screenshot.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 125px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/SivcmcyC15I/AAAAAAAAAFE/o8woMq27oIg/s200/screenshot.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5344607935924459410" border="0" /></a><br />I take no credit for the background. It comes from my friend's collection of wallpapers. The image for the panel is borrowed from the debian-moreblue theme, which is provided by default. The only thing I worked on is playing around with the value of the coordinates of the panel and with the fonts. Creating a theme for SLiM is ridiculously simple.<br /><br />Note: All the above files should be located in <code>/usr/share/themes/theme-name</code>, where <code>theme-name</code> should be replaced by any name that you want. For example in my case it is <code>/usr/share/themes/yeban</code><br /><br />There are essentially three parts of a slim theme.<br /><ol><li>A background image. The image file could be JPEG or PNG and should be named 'backgound.jpg' or 'background.png' depending on the image format you have.<br /></li><li>An  image to be used as the panel. Panel is the area where you enter your username and password. The image file could be JPEG or PNG and should be named 'panel.jpg' or 'panel.png' depending on the image format you have.</li><li>A configuration file which tells slim about the placement of the panel, the input boxes and the font to be used. This file is to be named 'slim.theme'. Here is mine.</li></ol><br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/129966.js"></script><br /><br />As you can see the settings are key-value pairs and the name of the keys are self explanatory. You can find a complte listing and explanation of the settings <a href="http://slim.berlios.de/themes_howto.php">here</a>.<br /><blockquote></blockquote>To put into effect the new theme you just created<br /><ol><li>Open the file <code>/etc/slim.conf</code><br /></li><li>Go to the <code>custom_theme</code> setting and change the default value to your <code>theme-name</code></li><li>Save the file and then login and logout to see the effect.</li></ol>You can download my theme from <a href="http://download.github.com/yeban-Yeban-Theme-for-SLiM-c1a16459b8fba02e70339f373a4306831de55705.tar.gz">git-hub</a>(zipped file), change the name to whatever you want and use it.
