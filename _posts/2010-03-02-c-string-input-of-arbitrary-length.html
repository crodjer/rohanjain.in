I had to implement a shell for my course on Operating Systems. While developing (on my personal laptop), to input the command as a string of arbitrary length I used the GNU Readline library. During demo, my code promptly failed to compile due to non existence of the library on the computers in the lab. This is what I wrote in five minutes then to save my ass.<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/319653.js?file=readline.c"></script>
