<p>Well, the first question that comes to mind after getting a hang of the 'almighty VIM' is "Is there a way to swap 'esc' key with something near the home row?".Aye! there is. Swap the 'esc' and 'caps lock' key. Here is how:<br /><ol><li>Fire up Vim to create an (say 'keymap') ASCII plain text file (<code>vim keymap</code>) with the content:<br /><code>remove Lock = Caps_Lock<br />keysym Escape = Caps_Lock<br />keysym Caps_Lock = Escape<br />add Lock = Caps_Lock<code></li><br /><li>now execute the command:<br /><code>xmodmap "filename"</code>, obviously without the quotes, and you are done.</li></ol><br />The above applies to all distros of linux. Personally I have tested it on Debian. And yes, the change is global.<br /></p>
