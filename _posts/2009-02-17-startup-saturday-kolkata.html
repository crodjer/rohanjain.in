Last Saturday, I attended my first Startup Saturday, Startup Saturday Kolkata 1. There were several other first timers too. It was held on 14th February (yes the lover-birds's day) at the Pearl Hotel with a turnup of around 25 people.<br /><br />A last-minute venue change from the IIT Kharagpur extension center delayed the start from 3:00 to 3:45 pm.<br /><br />To mark the begining of the event, <a href="http://blog.miteshashar.com/">Mitesh B Ashar</a> introduced '<a href="http://headstart.in/">Headstart</a>' and '<a href="http://startupsaturday.in/">Startup Saturday</a>'. The HeadStart Network is a not-for-profit organization run by volunteers and full time professionals to create and promote the innovation ecosystem in India. The innovation ecosystem, as defined by Headstart, 'consists of entrepreneurs and startups, researchers in academia and industry, adopters of new technology and products, and investors'. Startup Saturday is an initiatve taken by HeadStart that provides a platform for entrepreneurs to discuss, present, network, and learn from peers, prospective customers, adopters, partners, and investors. It currently happens in six cities across India on the second Saturday of every month.<br /><br />Second in the queue was a session by Anurup on understanding the landscape and nitty-gritties of selling and marketing products to the SME (Small Medium Enterprise) segment. Definition of SMBs is very vague. Every institution defines SMBs in its own way. To sell to a SMBs, it's important to maintain a favorable web presence. The general trend of IT-based SMBs is to offer SaaS (Softwre as a Service) or Cloud Computing solution like 'feature enabled digital media services'. An ad-based revenue model for SMBs could also work. For their own IT needs, they will readily take advice from their trusted 'know it all man'. The CIO hardly plays any role in SMBs.<br /><br />The Startup Saturday then quickly broke up into several sanbox sessions as Sikdar was unable to make to demo his latest venture, <a href="http://prepgenie.com/">PrepGenie.com</a>. A sandbox session invites members from the audience to speak on topics of their choice. Well, this gives me a Barcampish feeling. A round of introduction by all was followed by Neil speaking about <a href="http://www.calport.com/">Calport Technologies</a> (his web designing company).<br /><br />Summit then spoke about 'Community Radio', encouraging an open discussion. Licensing issues, scalability, and issues related to providing content was then discussed. Use of Asterisk to consolidate all the content was suggested.<br /><br />A surprising fact I learned: "Facebook has no proper revenue model". So don't be astonished if one day Facebook suddenly switches to a pay-model or just shuts down. Though Twitter is in the same boat, it has managed to raise several rounds of venture-capitalist funding. Any comments by the reader in this regard would be helpful.<br /><br />Came next a confabulation on Vikram's idea of "providing custom-designed products to the customers at an affordable cost", probably through a website. The customers' attitude to touch-and-buy design pieces could be a major setback. The formulaton remains unique to the customer, as it has been conceived especially for him/her. Modular furniture could be a product of choice.<br /><br />Abhishek Bakshi of IIM Shilong spoke next about his experiences at a DSP-based (Digital Signal Processing) startup, called Failsafe.<br /><br /><a href="http://artagnon.com/">Ram</a> (aka <a href="http://artagnon.com/">Artagnon</a>) of IIT Kharagpur initiated a really awesome dialogue on generative technologies. Generative technology offers you the playground to experiment with the way technologies works. BBS (Bulletin Board System) and Linux are a few examples to quote. Generative technology need not be better than non-generative. A wonderful example is the revolutionary iPhone (non-generative). The Andriod platform may be generative, but hasn't caught up yet.<br /><br />Mitesh concluded the event with a feedback session.<br /><br />External Links:<br /><a href="http://startupsaturday.in/index.php?title=Kolkata">Official Startup Saturday Kolkata Wiki.</a><br /><a href="http://dare.co.in/events/event-reports/headstart-launches-startup-saturday-kolkata.htm">DARE's coverage of the event.</a>
