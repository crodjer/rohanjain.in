When I switched over from Ubuntu to Debian, I often used to wonder why the fonts were not rendered by Debian as beautifully as Ubuntu did. Still it was usable, so I did not bother much. The question haunted me again when I ditched the Gnome Dekstop Environment in favor of <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome Window Manager</a>. Font rendering had deteriorated so much that long sessions had become totally impossible. Then I discovered this ".fonts.conf" file which made the font rendering on my Debian box as good as that of Ubuntu.<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/402984.js?file=fonts.conf"></script><br /><br />The contents of this gist goes in a ".fonts.conf" file in your home directory. You will probably have to restart your X server for the effects to take place.<br /><br />I had actually read up this trick on someone else's blog, and I  am unable to find the link again. So the credit goes to that author :).
