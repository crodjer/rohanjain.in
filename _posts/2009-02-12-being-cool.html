<p><br />Few of my friends recently raised the concern that 'I am heading towards geekdom and that I am not being as cool as they are'. So one day I had to lend my unwilling ears to their 'grand lecture' on portraying oneself as 'a cool dude'. The lesson culminated into a fight over "Metal vs. Hip Hop","Gyming vs. Sports", "Long Hairs vs. Short Hairs". And the docile pupil learnt his first lesson, "You have to be different." Wow! Brilliant eh! I dedicate this post to those peers of mine.<br /><br />Well, here comes links of some really cool pics.<br /><ol><li><a href="http://damncoolpics.blogspot.com/2009/02/crazy-bikes.html">A collection of really weird and unusual bikes from around the world.</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.nataliedee.com/042406/as-long-as-you-dont-swing-around-it-will-be-cool.jpg">As long as you don't swing around!</a></li><br /></ol><br /></p>
