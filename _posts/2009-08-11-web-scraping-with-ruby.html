Web scraping essentially is extracting useful data from websites. To do it in Ruby, I will use the excellent nokogiri (you can use hpricot as well) library in conjunction with firebug . Nokogiri is the fatest XML parsing library for Ruby and is available as a gem. Firebug is a development addon for firefox. We will be needing firebug only to analyse the structure of the webpage from which we want to scrape data.<br /><br /><br />
