What is web development or web programming? Is it just HTML/CSS? No. Add Javascript to that. Is that it? No. Aah, you missed out PHP. So, does that fill-in the gap. The answer still is, NO.<br /><br />Quoting directly from Wikipedia:<br /><blockquote><b>Web development</b> is a broad term for any activity related to developing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site" title="Web site" class="mw-redirect">web site</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet" title="Intranet">intranet</a>. This can include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce" title="E-commerce" class="mw-redirect">e-commerce</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_development" title="Business development">business development</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" title="Web design">web design</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_development" title="Web content development" class="mw-redirect">web content development</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting" title="Client-side scripting">client-side</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting" title="Server-side scripting">server-side</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming" title="Programming" class="mw-redirect">scripting</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" title="Web server">web server</a> configuration. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers only to the non-design aspects of building web sites, e.g. writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" title="Markup language">markup</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">coding</a>. Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text" title="Plain text">plain text</a> to the most complex web-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_application" title="Internet application" class="mw-redirect">internet applications</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_business" title="Electronic business">electronic businesses</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service" title="Social network service">social network services</a>.</blockquote><br />Here is what you need to understand and learn. Any website is made up of three parts:<br /><ol><li>The Data Layer - All the data/information relevant to your site is ultimately stored in a Database. Say, for a stock exchange website, the data is the name of the companies, the current value of the stocks, the previous values of the stocks and so on.</li><li>The User Interface Layer - This is your point of interaction with the user, where you collect data from him or present him with some data. For example you could display a form for registering users on your site or collecting some feedback, or, the stock exchange site showing you the results of your query.<br /></li><li>The Controller Layer - It is the pathway for your data to pass from the Data Layer to the User Interface layer and vice versa. This is where you perform queries to your database. Take the stock exchange site again for example. When you query for a company name say Reliance. So what you do is obtain the search term from the user (read passing the data from), query the database and display the result (read pass on the information to the user interface layer).</li></ol>Ever since I was selected for the web team of Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur, people have haunted me with the question "What exactly is web programming?" As a matter of fact even I was unsure of it at the time I was inducted in the group. Then began our (myself and Sid) training. Artagnon was respnsible for ittrained Myself and Sid.Indeed, this post tries to answer them. This will also serve as a one stop guide to anyone who is uninitiated to this field<br />
