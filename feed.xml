    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are far too many famous scientists, philosophers, authors that I admire who published their work in German. So, I am considering to put in some serious effort in learning the language and take on reading some of these famous works without any English translations.</p>
<p>Mostly likely, I’ll start with re-reading Wittgenstein’s, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12075.Tractatus_Logico_Philosophicus?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a> in german, specifically because of the unique style of writing. It will make comparing (and hence learning) with the translations easier.</p>
<p>Other popular authors I’d like to read are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein</li>
<li>Wittgenstein</li>
<li>Kant (too ambitious?)</li>
<li>Neitzche</li>
<li>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</li>
</ul>
<p>On a more practicle side, learning multiple languages is considered to be good for brain development. Moreover, its a good to have professionally.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I started learning the Rust programming language and was able to put in a fair amount of time doing that. Went through the official Rust book, played a bit with code. But the learning halted abruptly.</p>
<p>Now I am re-visiting it again. This time though, I’ll dive into actual code instead of passive reading. I may start a pet project (suggestions?), try some programming exercies or my favorite: start contributing to an existing project. So far, <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs">cobalt.rs</a> looks like a candidate. I am considering moving my personal website from Hakyll to Cobalt and then contribute patches for features that I’d like or bugs I find.</p>
<p>I have decided not to start Haskell again, for now anyway. Although I learnt immense amount of programming concepts from it, I was never able to move forward practically with it.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am fairly active on twitter. It is a very convenient place to register interesting thoughts and ideas. I actually like to revisit my twitter history frequently and each of the tweets function as a photograph to what my state of the mind, the context was at the time I published the tweet. Hence, I personally can recover most of the idea.</p>
<p>But 140 characters aren’t generally enough to convey the context plus the idea, leaving an immense amount of room for misunderstanding. To someone else reading the tweets, it mostly would be meaningless or worse, they’d end up misinterpreting it.</p>
<p>So, I have decided I’ll tweet less and try to keep them more accessible. There is no point in inflicting gratuitous ideas to public who most likely uses twitter as a news aggregator.</p>
<p>As far as keeping snapshots of my states of mind at various points of history is concerned, I am yet to figure that out. Maybe a good old physical notebook would do the job.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I have noticed my reading speed has picked up. It’s not so much the reading speed, but the will to read that is now higher. Partially, I’d attribute it to my sudden drop in binging TV serials that I have observed and partially it’s because of group of readers at my workplace.</p>
<p>Although, I have always been an active reader, I was able to read at 2-3 books per week in the last month or so. So, I’ll try to keep this momentum up as much as possible. I have set a target of 30 books over the year. I hope its a conservative goal.</p>
<p>I also realized that against what I thought would be the case, I read slower in Hindi compared to English. I’ll read a book or two in Hindi as well to improve the reading speed in my native language. Discovery (specially eBooks) is very difficult for non-English language books. It is a bothersome situation for the various not so mainstream on Internet languages on the internet.</p>

    <title>Navigating with the first telescope</title>
    <link href="http://www.rohanjain.in/telescope/" />
    <id>http://www.rohanjain.in/telescope/</id>
    <published>2016-05-12T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-05-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/sky/">previous post</a>, I wrote about my initial experiences with stargazing - primarily to demonstrate that it can be fascinating without fancy equipment. After those initial sessions, I bought a telescope which magnified my experience significantly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stars. Stars everywhere!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-telescope">The Telescope</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of an (astronomical) telescope, unlike popular belief, is not actually magnification. They act as light collectors (think burning a paper with a converging lens and sunlight).</p>
<p>Because the aperture of our eye is very small (7mm at best), we don’t capture enough light to see faint stars. Telescopes (and binoculars) can have much larger objectives and hence more surface area where the photon can hit.</p>
<p>Buying a telescope (or anything?) on an impulse is a bad idea. There are multiple articles/guides (like <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-equipment/how-to-choose-a-telescope/">this one</a>) that talk about various telescopes and their purposes. I’d recommend going through a few of those while having some direct gazing sessions, helps in setting up the preferences and expectations.</p>
<p>I personally enjoy looking at faint stars and deep sky objects or DSOs (star clusters, galaxies, nebulae) more compared to planets/moon. To start with, the objects that Charles Messier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects">catalogued</a>.</p>
<p>My telescope is a Newtonian reflector with a <strong>114mm</strong> aperture and <strong>900mm</strong> focal length. I have 3 kellner eyepieces of sizes (and magnifications) <strong>25mm (36x)</strong>, <strong>10mm (90x)</strong> and <strong>4mm (225x)</strong>. It has a <strong>6x24</strong> (i.e. 6x magnification and 24mm aperture) finder. To keep the weight (and price) at a minimum, I got an Altazimuth mount.</p>
<p>On the web, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000Y8C2Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=H3RLG5OMNQX6ZMOH">this scope</a> is similar to mine. But I’d actually recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DDW9UW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001DDW9UW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=U6A22R7IFLTDIBPQ.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DDW9UW">Orion XT6</a> for much better observations or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D12U1IK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00D12U1IK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=XUNVRD64WYTFUT6U">Orion StarBlast 4.5</a> for its portability.</p>
<h2 id="finding-things">Finding things</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_hopping#The_technique">Star hopping</a> is the technique that is conventionally used by armature astronomers. But with star charts, I also have <a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>, with which I get precise details of much fainter stars. Once having pointed the scope to a bright star, I synchronize my path with Stellarium. Because I am comparing stars in sky to a star in telescope, it is possible for me to end up at the exact locations of a DSO even if I can’t discern it because of light pollution.</p>
<p>I’ll write more about this in a future post.</p>
<h2 id="orion-nebula-m42">Orion Nebula (M42)</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula">Orion Nebula</a> is the brightest diffuse nebula in the sky and lies in the constellation Orion (which also hosts my favorite star, Betelgeuse). Although it looks nothing like the colourful and detailed photos on the internet. I see it as a fuzzy extended grey object, similar to <a href="http://messier.seds.org/Pics/History/m42m.jpg">Charles Messier’s sketch</a>. It is remarkable, nevertheless. The four young stars in its heart are distinctly noticeable. When Orion was accessible, it was a ritual for me spend a few minutes on it before anything else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Orion Nebula is an example of a stellar nursery where new stars are being born.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="open-star-clusters">Open star clusters</h2>
<p>Of all the DSOs, I find open star clusters the most exciting. I like to examine their finer details, matching each star with Stellarium’s rendering.</p>
<p>The constellation <strong>Canis Major</strong> hosts a few prominent clusters. <strong>M41</strong> was the first cluster I ever saw. It is fairly bright. I even sketched the star pattern on paper, which now stays on my table at work. <strong>NGC 2362 (Canis Major cluster)</strong>, although not actually from the Messier catalogue, is also interesting. Most of its brightness comes from the star τ Canis Majoris. I noticed it when I was meandering around the lower part of the constellation.</p>
<p>I saw a few clusters in and around the <strong>Puppis</strong> constellation. <strong>M93</strong> is a nice and bright cluster. At the time of my observation, M93 was straight above the star <strong>Asmidiske (ξ Pup)</strong>. Asmidiske, being yellow, is a sight in itself. It has two companion stars nearby. <strong>M47</strong> and <strong>M46</strong> are categorized to be in Puppis, but I used Canis Major, Hydra and Monoceros as reference for them. M47 is bright, but M46 isn’t as noticeable with my setup.</p>
<p><strong>Taurus</strong> had a significance for me as the host to <strong>Pleiades (M45)</strong>. It is a cluster of very bright stars, with the brightest few visible without any optical instruments.</p>
<p><strong>M35</strong> in <strong>Gemini</strong> is yet another bright cluster that I observed.</p>
<h2 id="planets">Planets</h2>
<p>Planets are like stars but brighter and without the twinkling. With a telescope, a few more details may be seen.</p>
<p>The planet I have most observed is <strong>Jupiter</strong>. Initially, to my disappointment, I could only make out an extend bright white disk. Eventually, my skills improved (Jupiter moved toward opposition as well) and I could actually make out the colors and the stripes. By coincidence I even got to see the great red spot. Jupiter rotates about its axis very fast (8 hour days), and I never had actually planned a sighting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By Jupiter’s moving toward opposition, its the Earth’s movement in between the Sun and Jupiter which has significance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of all the planets, I was most interested in <strong>Saturn</strong>. Having straightened my expectations, I was not disappointed on first sight. The ring is indeed present and looks beautiful. I haven’t been able to see the Cassini’s division yet though. More sitting of Saturn gazing are upcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Mars</strong> is a red/orange disk with no other features visible (yet). I saw <strong>Venus</strong> only for a few minutes. Its unlikely that I’d be able to see <strong>Mercury</strong> from where I am.</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong> (although not a planet) can be seen in fine details. It is the only object which is bright enough to take photos of with my phone’s camera. But other than that, I find it uninteresting. Moreover, it obliterates my eye’s dark adjustment. Moonless nights are the best for stargazing.</p>
<h2 id="nebulae-globular-clusters-and-galaxies">Nebulae, Globular clusters and Galaxies</h2>
<p>These tend to be faint and the city lights takes away the required contrast for their visibility. My eyes probably caught photons originating from even the ones I couldn’t identify, because I verify the location I am pointing at based on the nearby faint stars.</p>
<p>The DSO which took up most of my time is <strong>M1 (Crab nebula)</strong>. It is a supernova remnant in <strong>Taurus</strong>. I must have put in 6+ hours cumulative in attempts to observe it. Infact, I remember much of the star patterns near the nebula. But, wouldn’t claim to have seen the nebula itself.</p>
<p>Another such object is <strong>M78</strong>, a reflection nebula in <strong>Orion</strong>. I have the nearby star patterns for it memorized as well. If at all, I saw a very dark grey and fuzzy object. <strong>M43</strong> is nebula right beside Orion nebula. I couldn’t discern it at all though, because of the imposing adjacent nebula.</p>
<p><strong>M53</strong>, a globular cluster in Coma Berenices, is visible as a dim round grey object. <strong>M68</strong> is a globular cluster in Hydra. But I could not clearly distinguish it.</p>
<p><strong>M104</strong> (Sombrero Galaxy) lies near Virgo. I recently started observing it. I did notice the presence of something, but may just be an illusion. The view should improve in the future sightings.</p>
<h2 id="limiting-magnitude">Limiting Magnitude</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In astronomy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_magnitude">limiting magnitude</a> is the faintest apparent magnitude of a celestial body that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.<br />
- Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find figuring out the limiting magnitude for my telescope interesting. Theoretically, I should be able to see stars up to an apparent magnitude of <strong>12.8</strong>, but I can’t actually. The lower the apparent magnitude of on object, the brighter it is. My skills, light pollution, quality of optics and the atmosphere bring this down significantly. The faintest stars I have seen, with significant effort, are roughly of magnitude <strong>11.2</strong>. Usually, I can conveniently see stars upto <strong>10</strong> and with a bit of effort (a second or so of concentration), <strong>10.5</strong>.</p>
<p>Because of how our eye are designed, moving it during observations and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averted_vision">averted vision</a> improves the ability to distinguish very low contrast objects.</p>

    <title>Gazing in the night sky</title>
    <link href="http://www.rohanjain.in/sky/" />
    <id>http://www.rohanjain.in/sky/</id>
    <published>2016-05-04T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-05-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 6 months ago, I picked up a new hobby: Stargazing. Starting off with just naked eyes, I quickly realized that there is actually quite a lot to see without any optical equipment. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en">Sky Map</a> and <a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a> are incredibly useful applications for a dilettante like me.</p>
<h2 id="dark-adjustment">Dark adjustment</h2>
<p>Before any stargazing session, dark adjustment i.e. dilating the pupils completely to improve night vision, is essential. I turn off all kinds of lights in the house and listen to podcasts for a while (at least 30 minutes). I go out to stargaze when the outside looks brighter than inside.</p>
<p>Avoiding the bright lights from neighbours can be a challenge though. Moon’s an issue as well.</p>
<h2 id="constellations">Constellations</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> (m) of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The smaller the number, the brighter a star appears.<br />
- Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time I started, the most identifiable constellation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)">Orion</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>, reddish orange star in Orion, very quickly became my favorite star. It gets the designation α Orionis even though Rigel is the brightest star in Orion (β Orionis). Betelgeuse’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> varies between 0-1.3, making it at times the brightest star in Orion. The star is huge - 630 times the radius of the sun. It was the first star (other than the Sun) to be imaged beyond a point source.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)">Taurus</a> is another constellation that I observed in my initial stargazing period. It extends over a large area, so not as identifiable. But it is a host for a unique star cluster: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades">Pleiades</a>. The 5-6 bright stars in the cluster are a singular sight with naked eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major">Canis Major</a> also has a significance for me as the host for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius">Sirius</a> (the brightest star). Its relatively close, being only about 8.6 light years away.</p>
<p>There were some other constellations as well, but I haven’t paid them too much attention. Listing some off the top of my head: Gemini, Puppis, Hydra and Virgo. But I couldn’t identify them without Orion / Canis Major as anchors.</p>
<h2 id="moon">Moon</h2>
<p>Moon’s the most noticeable and obvious site in the sky. At times, based on the shape of the moon’s bright portion, I’d try to visualize how the Sun, the Moon and the Earth are positioned relative to each other. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22°_halo">22° halo</a> around the moon is also nice to look at. To be honest though, I am always more interested in the Moon’s absence, since it impacts the visibility of stars significantly. It also damages my eye’s dark adjustment.</p>
<h2 id="planets">Planets</h2>
<p>The first 6 planets are readily visible to the naked eye. Although, Earth’s little too close to have an astronomical perspective. Because planets are at a distance and visible as extend objects, they don’t twinkle. This makes it easy to differentiate them from stars. Even <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000725.html">Betelgeuse</a> twinkles.</p>
<p>March this year, Jupiter was at the opposition (Earth being roughly in between the Sun and Jupiter) and had its closest approach to us. Hence, it was at its brightest.</p>
<p>Venus is always very bright (3rd brightest after the Sun and the Moon), but is visible near the Sunrise and the Sunset (hence called the morning/evening star).</p>
<p>Mars and Saturn as of now are located nearby. Mars is bright reddish in color and Saturn is yellowish in color.</p>
<p>22nd January 2016 was a interesting day for planet watching. The 5 planets were <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/160120-planet-parade-stargazing-astronomy/">all aligned</a> for the first time in over a decade.</p>
<p>The path that the Sun and the planets take also point toward the flatness of the solar system. Feels nice to get some empirical evidence of this, against just having this told.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-objects">Artificial objects</h2>
<p>A few artificial objects orbiting the Earth can be seen as well. For them, the sunset happens later (or sunrise earlier) than us, providing us with the dark background and enough contrast for the sunlight they reflect. The International Space Station (ISS), because of its size ends up being brighter than even Venus. <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">This NASA’s site</a> can be used to plan an ISS sighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare#Iridium_flares">Iridium</a> satellites’ flares are also noticeable at times. There are ways to plan their sightings, but I haven’t done that yet.</p>
<h2 id="limiting-magnitude-lm">Limiting Magnitude (LM)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In astronomy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_magnitude">limiting magnitude</a> is the faintest apparent magnitude of a celestial body that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.<br />
- Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to calculate the limiting magnitude. This would give me an idea of the light pollution and what I should expect to see. I notice light pollution in Pune is (unsurprisingly) more than that in Jaipur. From <a href="http://www.imo.net/visual/major/observation/lm">these charts</a>, I calculated the LM at Pune to be about 4.5. I came to doubt that when I eventually started using <a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>. The naked eye LM at my place is roughly 3.5 - 3.8.</p>
<p>I should give using the charts another try. At the time, I had used the Tau (using stars in/near Taurus) chart which has a magnitude gap of 1.62 between 3 and 4 visible stars.</p>
<h2 id="wonders">Wonders</h2>
<p>Stargazing results in multiple interesting and unsettling thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I see a star, the photons hitting my eyes are 1000s of year old. For example: Light from Betelgeuse travels for roughly 643 years to reach us.</li>
<li>I are literally looking at the past of those stars. But again, at these scales, the concept of present can be doubted. Einstein talks about the <em>The relativity of simultaneity</em> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420946331/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1420946331&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=CY4F7W7SQWMXRNIL">his book</a>.</li>
<li>The insignificance of the Earth’s and us with it in the universe.</li>
<li>We most probably aren’t alone.</li>
<li>How amazingly useful constellations are in navigating the sky.</li>
<li>How made up constellations are and the irrational significance humans give to them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="telescope">Telescope</h2>
<p>After a month of naked eye stargazing, I bought a telescope (similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000Y8C2Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=H3RLG5OMNQX6ZMOH">this one</a> but with better eyepieces) from a local provider. I’ll write about my observations with that over the next few days.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><br />
You can add arbitrary tags to your email address. Any email sent to <code>your-email+tag@your-provider.ext</code> will land in the inbox for <code>your-email@your-provider.ext</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emails are important. They are your identity on the web. Just like on phone, you’d want to control who can contact you via email. This warrants caution in signing up at places on the internet. It can be unsafe to register with the personal email address on new services for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bulk data breaches <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/biggest-worst-data-breaches-hacks_us_55d4b5a5e4b07addcb44fd9e">are fairly common</a>. You don’t want your email address out there for bots around the world to feed on.</li>
<li>The service you are signing up for may itself be malicious. Or worse, it may be Facebook!</li>
<li>Same email address on every service can make it simpler for bots to break into your accounts once they succeed in attacking one.</li>
<li>There <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/gmail/">are actual services</a> dedicated for creating single points of catastrophic failures utilizing email addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sound upsetting, but are indeed manageable to an extent. One trick that I use is <em>tagging the email address</em>. It is a fairly common practice among programmers. Most popular email services support this.</p>
<p>What do I mean by tagging? Lets take Jon’s email: <code>jon.snow@email.wf</code>. His sister, Arya, will know this address as is. But for the untrustworthy Lannisters, he tags the email: <code>jon.snow+lannister@email.wf</code>. When someone writes to this address: he will receive the mails knowing that Lannisters were involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>email.wf</code> here is a fictional service, analogous to <code>gmail.com</code>. I didn’t want to accidentally use an actual email address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One may use a similar technique while signing up for services on the internet. Say Jon wants to register on <code>nightswatch.got</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Night’s Watch</em> registration form, he’d use <code>jon.snow+nighstwatch@email.wf</code> as the email. The tag <code>+nighstwatch</code> here is arbitrarily chosen.</li>
<li>Jon will get the confirmation mail in the original account. Being prudent, he’ll verify that the mail it does have the correct tag in the <em>to address</em>.</li>
<li>Also, <code>email.wf</code> lets Jon send emails with the tagged address. This is useful for talking to the customer care. GMail users can go to:<br />
<code>Settings -&gt; Accounts and Import -&gt; Add another email address you own</code>.<br />
and filling up the form with the tagged address.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means Jon can have practically infinite email addresses. Why is this helpful?</p>
<ul>
<li>Jon can collect all the mails from <em>Night’s Watch</em> at one place, specially when their mails aren’t consistent enough to write filters.</li>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I decided to categorize my posts under directories named by the year they were created in. For example, this post is placed at: <code>posts/2015/hakyll-years.mkd</code>. I decided to utilize this structure to also group how archives are listed. Inspired from <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/reference/src/Hakyll-Web-Tags.html">Hakyll’s tag functionality</a> I wrote my own group by years functionality. This post tries to explain that. Also, I don’t see why a similar logic cannot be used to do simple pagination.</p>
<p>First, like tags, we need to build the list of years. <code>buildYears</code> (like <code>buildTags</code>) will do that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">buildYears ::</span> <span class="dt">MonadMetadata</span> m <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Pattern</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m [(<span class="dt">Year</span>, <span class="dt">Int</span>)]
buildYears pattern <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    ids <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getMatches pattern
    return <span class="fu">.</span> frequency <span class="fu">.</span> (map getYear) <span class="fu">$</span> ids
  <span class="kw">where</span>
    frequency xs <span class="fu">=</span>  M.toList (M.fromListWith (<span class="fu">+</span>) [(x, <span class="dv">1</span>) <span class="fu">|</span> x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> xs])

<span class="ot">getYear ::</span> <span class="dt">Identifier</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Year</span>
getYear <span class="fu">=</span> takeBaseName <span class="fu">.</span> takeDirectory <span class="fu">.</span> toFilePath</code></pre></div>
<p>This now can be used in the site <code>Rules</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  years <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> buildYears <span class="st">&quot;posts/*/*&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this, you have a list of years available for other rules to use. Now, we build an index of posts by years (similar to <code>tagsRules</code>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  forM_ years <span class="fu">$</span> \(year, _)<span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
      create [yearId year] <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
         route   idRoute
         compile <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
           <span class="co">-- Only the posts published in &#39;year&#39;</span>
           posts <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> recentFirst <span class="fu">=&lt;&lt;</span> loadAll (fromGlob <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="st">&quot;posts/&quot;</span> <span class="fu">++</span> year <span class="fu">++</span><span class="st">&quot;/*&quot;</span>)
           <span class="kw">let</span> postsCtx <span class="fu">=</span> mconcat
                          [ listField <span class="st">&quot;posts&quot;</span> postCtx (return posts)
                          , constField <span class="st">&quot;title&quot;</span> (<span class="st">&quot;Posts published in &quot;</span> <span class="fu">++</span> year)
                          , defaultContext
                          ]
           makeItem <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> loadAndApplyTemplate <span class="st">&quot;templates/posts.html&quot;</span> postsCtx
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> loadAndApplyTemplate <span class="st">&quot;templates/default.html&quot;</span> postsCtx
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> relativizeUrls
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> cleanIndexUrls

<span class="ot">yearPath ::</span> <span class="dt">Year</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> FilePath
yearPath year <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;archive/&quot;</span> <span class="fu">++</span> year <span class="fu">++</span> <span class="st">&quot;/&quot;</span>

<span class="ot">yearId ::</span> <span class="dt">Year</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Identifier</span>
yearId <span class="fu">=</span> fromFilePath <span class="fu">.</span> yearPath</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have year wise archives which can be accessed through paths like: <code>/archive/2015/</code>. Similar to tags, we need to support browsing through posts by years. <code>renderYears</code> does that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="co">-- Extra blaze related imports</span>
<span class="kw">import           </span><span class="dt">Text.Blaze.Html</span>                 (toHtml, toValue, (!))
<span class="kw">import           </span><span class="dt">Text.Blaze.Html.Renderer.String</span> (renderHtml)
<span class="kw">import qualified</span> <span class="dt">Text.Blaze.Html5</span>                <span class="kw">as</span> <span class="dt">H</span>

renderYears years <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
  years&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> forM (reverse <span class="fu">.</span> sort <span class="fu">$</span> years) <span class="fu">$</span> \(year, count) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
      route&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getRoute <span class="fu">$</span> yearId year
      return (year, route&#39;, count)
  return <span class="fu">.</span> intercalate <span class="st">&quot;, &quot;</span> <span class="fu">$</span> map makeLink years&#39;

  <span class="kw">where</span>
    makeLink (year, route&#39;, count) <span class="fu">=</span>
      (renderHtml (H.a <span class="fu">!</span> A.href (yearUrl year) <span class="fu">$</span> toHtml year)) <span class="fu">++</span>
      <span class="st">&quot; (&quot;</span> <span class="fu">++</span> show count <span class="fu">++</span> <span class="st">&quot;)&quot;</span>
    yearUrl <span class="fu">=</span> toValue <span class="fu">.</span> toUrl <span class="fu">.</span> yearPath</code></pre></div>
<p>Add this to a pages context like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  create [<span class="st">&quot;index.html&quot;</span>] <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
         route   idRoute
         compile <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
           <span class="co">-- rest of the compiler context</span>
           <span class="kw">let</span> indexCtx <span class="fu">=</span> mconcat
                          [ <span class="co">-- some context</span>
                          , field <span class="st">&quot;years&quot;</span> (\_ <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> renderYears years)
                          , defaultContext
                          ]
           <span class="co">-- rest of the compiler</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>$years$</code> will be available in the template which will link to year wise archives with their corresponding per year count.</p>

<p>Also, you’d notice that years here could easily have been various categories you may want to have in your blog.</p>

    <title>Sitemap with Hakyll</title>
    <link href="http://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-sitemap/" />

    <updated>2015-08-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its fairly trivial to configure <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> to generate sitemaps. Sitemaps helps search engines websites. Similar to any typical html page, create a template - <code>templates/sitemap.xml</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;?xml</span> version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;<span class="kw">?&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;urlset</span><span class="ot"> xmlns=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
$for(entries)$
    <span class="kw">&lt;url&gt;</span>
        <span class="kw">&lt;loc&gt;</span>$host$$url$<span class="kw">&lt;/loc&gt;</span>
        <span class="kw">&lt;changefreq&gt;</span>weekly<span class="kw">&lt;/changefreq&gt;</span>
        $if(lastmod)$<span class="kw">&lt;lastmod&gt;</span>$lastmod$<span class="kw">&lt;/lastmod&gt;</span>$endif$
        <span class="kw">&lt;priority&gt;</span>0.8<span class="kw">&lt;/priority&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;/url&gt;</span>
$endfor$
<span class="kw">&lt;/urlset&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, using the templates, create a rule which uses all the pages from the site as entries. Here is what I do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  create [<span class="st">&quot;sitemap.xml&quot;</span>] <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
         route   idRoute
         compile <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
           posts <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> recentFirst <span class="fu">=&lt;&lt;</span> loadAll <span class="st">&quot;posts/*/*&quot;</span>
           pages <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> loadAll <span class="st">&quot;pages/*&quot;</span>
           <span class="kw">let</span> allPosts <span class="fu">=</span> (return (pages <span class="fu">++</span> posts))
           <span class="kw">let</span> sitemapCtx <span class="fu">=</span> mconcat
                            [ listField <span class="st">&quot;entries&quot;</span> pageCtx allPosts
                            , constField <span class="st">&quot;host&quot;</span> host
                            , defaultContext
                            ]
           makeItem <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> loadAndApplyTemplate <span class="st">&quot;templates/sitemap.xml&quot;</span> sitemapCtx
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> cleanIndexHtmls</code></pre></div>
<p>This generates <a href="/sitemap.xml" class="uri">/sitemap.xml</a> which can be submitted to search engines for indexing.</p>

    <title>Clean URLs with Hakyll</title>
    <link href="http://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-clean-urls/" />
    <id>http://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-clean-urls/</id>
    <published>2015-08-30T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-08-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The URLs generated by <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, by default also include a <code>.html</code> extension. I have never been a fan of this. When things in reality are driven by the <code>Content-Type</code> header, it is absolutely redundant.</p>
<p>Hakyll provides all the utilities with which we can get cleaner URLs, like <a href=".">this page’s</a>. For this, I rely on the fact that most of the web servers automatically serve <code>/foo/</code> for the URL <code>/foo/</code>. To generate <em>clean</em> paths, I define a custom route - <code>cleanRoute</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">cleanRoute ::</span> <span class="dt">Routes</span>
cleanRoute <span class="fu">=</span> customRoute createIndexRoute
  <span class="kw">where</span>
    createIndexRoute ident <span class="fu">=</span> takeDirectory p <span class="fu">&lt;/&gt;</span> takeBaseName p <span class="fu">&lt;/&gt;</span> <span class="st">&quot;index.html&quot;</span>
                            <span class="kw">where</span> p <span class="fu">=</span> toFilePath ident</code></pre></div>
<p>This can now be used in in rule definition:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  match <span class="st">&quot;pages/*&quot;</span> <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
         route   <span class="fu">$</span> cleanRoute
         <span class="co">-- the compiler follows</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this, a path say <code>/pages/about.html</code> will be generated as <code>/pages/about/</code>, hence solving the generation problem. We are only partially done though. The links that Hakyll generates will also include the <code>/</code> suffix in every URL. To get rid of that we define a set of functions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">cleanIndexUrls ::</span> <span class="dt">Item</span> <span class="dt">String</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Compiler</span> (<span class="dt">Item</span> <span class="dt">String</span>)
cleanIndexUrls <span class="fu">=</span> return <span class="fu">.</span> fmap (withUrls cleanIndex)

<span class="ot">cleanIndexHtmls ::</span> <span class="dt">Item</span> <span class="dt">String</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Compiler</span> (<span class="dt">Item</span> <span class="dt">String</span>)
cleanIndexHtmls <span class="fu">=</span> return <span class="fu">.</span> fmap (replaceAll pattern replacement)
    <span class="kw">where</span>
      pattern <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;/&quot;</span>
      replacement <span class="fu">=</span> const <span class="st">&quot;/&quot;</span>

<span class="ot">cleanIndex ::</span> <span class="dt">String</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">String</span>
cleanIndex url
    <span class="fu">|</span> idx <span class="ot">`isSuffixOf`</span> url <span class="fu">=</span> take (length url <span class="fu">-</span> length idx) url
    <span class="fu">|</span> otherwise            <span class="fu">=</span> url
  <span class="kw">where</span> idx <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;index.html&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>cleanIndexUrls</code> and <code>cleanIndexHtmls</code> strip out <code>/</code> from all the anchor tags and complete text respectively. These can be used over a page’s compiler like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">         compile <span class="fu">$</span> pandocCompiler
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> loadAndApplyTemplate <span class="st">&quot;templates/page.html&quot;</span> pageCtx
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> saveSnapshot <span class="st">&quot;content&quot;</span>
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> loadAndApplyTemplate <span class="st">&quot;templates/default.html&quot;</span> pageCtx
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> relativizeUrls
            <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> cleanIndexUrls <span class="co">-- cleanup href in all anchor tags.</span></code></pre></div>
