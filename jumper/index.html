internet as they are spread across the country:</p><ul><li><code>descartes</code>: My dad&rsquo;s Debian desktop (1800 km away).</li><li><code>kant</code>: RPi 3 running Arch (a NAS, printer, a wormhole).</li><li><code>camus</code>: RPi 4 running Manjaro (my personal work machine).</li><li><code>nietzsche</code>: My wife&rsquo;s Manjaro notebook.</li><li>Phones: <code>newton</code>, <code>feyman</code>, <code>einstine</code> and <code>sagan</code>.</li><li><code>kepler</code>: a tiny Debian on Google Cloud.</li><li><code>webb</code>: a tiny Ubuntu Server on Oracle Cloud.</li></ul><blockquote><p>All the computers actually have different astronomy inspired names.</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, I found my lost RPi 2 hidden in a bag&rsquo;s pocket, so it&rsquo;ll
also find a place among all the others (likely a second wormhole at
my parens&rsquo;).</p><p>For a long time, I was using <a href=/vnc/>reverse SSH based tunnels</a>, which
worked reliably, but was slow (a US based VM) and not the cleanest. I
couldn&rsquo;t easily add machines and each machine would need to SSH in
opening a reverse SSH tunnel which I&rsquo;d need to note somewhere.</p><p>For the last year or so though, I have been using
<a href=https://www.zerotier.com/>ZeroTier</a>. It works relibably and is easy
to administer through the web interface. Being peer-to-peer, it is
very low latency and sloved all my problems. So, the reverse SSH
tunnels was now a redundant setup for me.</p><p>That is, until now. I finally got around to setup a <a href=https://www.wireguard.com>WireGuard</a> server.
WireGuard is surprisingly simple to setup and works reliably. There
are multiple guides on how to set it up (hence I didn&rsquo;t yet another),
like <a href=https://wiki.debian.org/SimplePrivateTunnelVPNWithWireGuard>this one</a>.
The way to administor it is a bit more involved than ZeroTier, but
once setup, it works transparently. Interestingly, the hop latency
doesn&rsquo;t take much of a hit because the cloud VM sits near the line
connecting me and my parents'.</p><p>I am happy with the setup now with ZeroTier and WireGuard serving as
each other&rsquo;s redundancy.</p><p>Interestingly, the VPNs aren&rsquo;t even the primary network tool that I
use. All these devices share most of their data with each other via
<a href=https://syncthing.net/>syncthing</a>. Syncthing is an awesome piece of technology allowing
me to have redundancy and local access to files. Run <a href=https://docs.syncthing.net/users/strelaysrv.html>a relay</a> or
<a href=https://syncthing.net/donations/>donate</a> if you can.</p></article></main><footer><a href=/blog>All Posts</a>
