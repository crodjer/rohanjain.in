Hi, I am Rohan. I read and write code. I frequently read about physics, energy
and climate change. After getting depressed enough of the latter, I read fiction
or annoy my friends about it or just code.

I like to play table tennis, cricket and chess. I also bought a
harmonica. Keep your hands on ears if you see me holding it. And yeah, I maintain a blog, which is so devoid of activity that it should have cobwebs on
it.
