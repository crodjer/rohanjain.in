    <div class='post-text'>
        
        <p>I have always tried to stay away from PHP. Python has always been my language
of choice. But, recently I got to write a considerable amount of code in PHP,
for my current projects. They are based on a web framework called
<a href="http://codeigniter.com/">Codeigniter</a>. Being completely inexperienced in
writing production code with PHP, I did struggle with it a bit.</p>

<p>As a language PHP has its pros and cons. This post includes my personal
opinions so, tagged as &lsquo;subjective&rsquo;.</p>

<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>

<h2 id="comprehensive-documentation">Comprehensive documentation</h2>
<p>PHP has a really high adoption, so has a rather comprehensive amount of
resources available over the web. If you run into some issue, you can mostly be
sure that some else has had the same issue as well proceed as that person did.</p>

<h2 id="c-like-syntax">C like syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax is not much alien to C, which is a language most of the programmers
know from their &ldquo;Programming 101&rdquo;s. So the initial slope of the learning curve
is not steep.</p>

<h2 id="lots-of-libraries">Lots of libraries</h2>
<p>Want to implement something? There is probably an existing library which does
that for me. Hence, you can save yourself from writing lots of code. Infact for
any new web technology PHP is always amongst the languages which get a
library first.</p>

<h2 id="common-web-development-language">Common web development language</h2>
<p>If one is assembling a team, it is probably true that PHP developers will be
the easiest to find. So one could just choose PHP as the language.</p>

<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
<p>With PHP 5.3 and up, anonymous functions are available. These are very useful,
particularly in array maps and callbacks.</p>

<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>

<h2 id="the--operator">The <code>||</code> operator</h2>
<p>The results from the or (<code>||</code>) should be one of the operands instead it returns
<code>1</code> or <code>0</code> which is useless most of the time.</p>

<h2 id="error-reporting">Error reporting</h2>
<p>Lot of errors that occur while execution, just fail silently or with warnings
and the execution continues. Why not just halt the script execution and let
the programmers deal with it, they can take it.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-no-promises">There are no promises</h2>
<p>You cannot promise PHP that <code>foo</code> will return an array, so it is not possible
to just do <code>foo(arg)['key']</code> to get a particular index of the array resulting
from the function call.  Instead a temporary variable, <code>$foo_result</code> is needed.
Because of this you can&rsquo;t chain function calls to apply multiple functions
over a variable. This is particularly annoying with arrays, while doing various
manipulations over them.</p>

<h2 id="embedding-code-in-html">Embedding code in HTML</h2>
<p>Some might say that this is a good thing, but I don&rsquo;t believe so. This doesn&rsquo;t
let you decouple the templates from the application back end. Templates get
too much power and projects end up with some application logic in templates.</p>

<h2 id="lots-of-libraries-1">Lots of libraries</h2>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this a pro too? It was but this also has some negative effect. There
are multiple libraries available, sometimes for doing the same task. They
don&rsquo;t have wide contexts. Each might fulfill functionality that one requires
partially but not all.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>PHP is definitely a major server side scripting language. Its popularity, the
ease to build developer teams counts as a reason for choosing PHP. But, given
a choice, PHP will always be on the lower side of my priority list. I&rsquo;ll
mostly go with full fledged languages like Python. With
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>
around, server side Javascript also looks promising. To get around their
limitations they can always be used in parallel with other systems.
Its better to have multiple decoupled systems, providing reasonable APIs and
implemented in a technology best for each of them, talk to each other instead
of writing everything down in the same language.</p>
