    <div class='post-text'>
        
        <p>Some months ago I decided about the what my new <a href="http://j.mp/o043VH">computer&rsquo;s configuration</a>
will be. It was a really powerful machine with all the latest
parts (they still are latest!). Its main strength was the new intel processor
architecture - <a href="http://j.mp/qbjSyR">Sandy Bridge</a>. I had ruled out laptops
considering the higer costs with lower configuration and absence of the Sandy
Bridge architecture.</p>

<p>But due to unavailablility of processor and motherboard in India, I had to wait
for a long time till I figured out how to get all the parts. While the wait, I
started doing a smart upgrade of my existing notebook. I got a new monitor,
keyboard (The generic stuff). The one unique thing that not many people try was
a <strong>Solid State Drive</strong> (glad I am enjoying one). About this time only I took
a look at the detailed configuration of my laptop and upgrade options. I was
surprised to see that the maximum resolution the machine served was upto
8192 x 8192. After the SSD and a memory upgrade I was surprised to see the
performance boost and thanks it was giving me back. I was having all the fun
using multiple screens and not caring if I left any programs open. So I decided
to not get any new machine at all and keep using my CQ40-144TU for a while till
I find something worth upgrading in the market.</p>

<p>Since the time when I first decided for a new machine and now, I saw that there
were a <em>lot</em> of notebooks availabe with the <em>2nd Generation Core i series</em>
(Sandy Bridge) processors and at compelling prices. So I started a new search
with queries: <strong>Intel HD Graphics 3000</strong> (Ensures Sandy Bridge arch. and no
power hungry graphics card), <strong>Core i5</strong> (Ensures hyper threading and more than
required processing power) and <strong>Free DOS</strong> (Of Course! - I dont want to waste
such a nice notebook with windows). There are some notebooks which come out
as reasonable buys.</p>

<p>I ruled out Dell on the first go as it only seems like it that they allow you
to customize, but they don&rsquo;t. If you want a simple machine without <a href="http://j.mp/o7Zb36">all the
useless</a> (it is subjective) stuffs like Online backup (If I
wanted one I would use a VPS , Windows (I can&rsquo;t understand why force it!) or
replaceable covers (I am getting a computer not a doll to play with!). What I
want is a processor + motherboard with some notebook essentials with it. HP and
ThinkPads are the brands I am looking at now. They provide some business
notebooks which serve all my purposes.<br />
I&rsquo;ll tell about the final machine which I bought in some newer post.</p>

<p>Still, I would always miss my old machine, which has always been there with me
for roughly 1.5 years. It is still doing pretty good (This post is written with
one only) and has more upgrade capabilities. It is well over <em>good enough</em> as a
general usage computer.</p>
