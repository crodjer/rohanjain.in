discussion about this with a friend. There isn&rsquo;t an obvious service that
currently exists which would fill in the void that Twitter might leave. Other
than what Twitter what already provides, we needed something more resilient. So,
it could be de-centralized, i.e. not dependent on a single server to provide
content.</p><p>Hmm, we want a client-server architecture. It could be a standardized protocol.
Services would spin up for non-tech people so that they could host their content
on them. Then because of the standardized protocol, people could innovate on
clients as well! Continue the discussion on this for a few more seconds and
then&mldr;wait! This already exists. The world already uses it, and quiet
successfully. And, it is an open standard. We were trying to invent blogs and
RSS!</p><p>And there was an end to a short brainstorming session.</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/blog>Back to posts</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class=icons><div class=container><div class=content><a href=//github.com/crodjer target=_blank rel=noopener>Github</a>
