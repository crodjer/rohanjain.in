Amethyst, a window manager with basic XMonad bindings.

quickly became habitual.
Mjolinr, which is configured in Lua and can actually be quite powerful.

last 6 months, I have been using a two window strategy. That is:</p><p><strong>The primary workflow must be dependent on at max two windows.</strong></p><p>This means that any application I want to have in my workflow must run in either
of those windows.</p><p>Those windows in my case are:</p><ul><li><em>iTerm2</em><br>This includes a <code>tmux</code> session, with multiple windows. The first window will
run a in-terminal emacs client and the rest all windows will various shell
sessions and split configurations of their own. This way, I&rsquo;ll spend most of
my time within a tmux session.</li><li><em>Browser</em><br>Apart from functioning as a browser, it serves as an host for applications
such as: Mail, Slack, Calender.</li></ul><p>There are multiple benefits of this setup:</p><ul><li>Quick window switching.</li><li>Universal workflow. Use it on RaspberryPi, remote machines, Linux TTY.</li><li>Keystrokes are deterministic. Just queue in the keystrokes and let the
computer execute things at its own pace. This also is my major complaint
against touch phones (compared to say, an old Nokia QWERTY phone).</li><li>I use Vim as a text editor for anything non Clojure. With tmux splits panes,
all of the context stays in the same tmux window.</li></ul><p>There are drawbacks too:</p><ul><li>Not every application can run in the browser/terminal. Because of this, you
end up negotiating for alternates.</li><li>Although most of Emacs works well in terminal, some bindings at times won&rsquo;t
work. This isn&rsquo;t a issue for me particularly.</li></ul><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=/blog>Back to posts</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class=icons><div class=container><div class=content><a href=//github.com/crodjer target=_blank rel=noopener>Github</a>
