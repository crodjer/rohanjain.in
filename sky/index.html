| 5 minutes read</small></header><p>About 6 months ago, I picked up a new hobby: Stargazing. Starting off with just
naked eyes, I quickly realized that there is actually quite a lot to see without
any optical equipment. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en">Sky Map</a> and <a href=http://stellarium.org/>Stellarium</a> are incredibly useful
applications for a dilettante like me.</p><h2 id=dark-adjustment><a class=heading-anchor href=#dark-adjustment aria-label="Permalink to Dark adjustment">§</a>
Dark adjustment</h2><p>Before any stargazing session, dark adjustment i.e. dilating the pupils
completely to improve night vision, is essential. I turn off all kinds of lights
in the house and listen to podcasts for a while (at least 30 minutes). I go out
to stargaze when the outside looks brighter than inside.</p><p>Avoiding the bright lights from neighbours can be a challenge though. Moon&rsquo;s an
issue as well.</p><h2 id=constellations><a class=heading-anchor href=#constellations aria-label="Permalink to Constellations">§</a>
Constellations</h2><blockquote><p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude>apparent magnitude</a> (m) of a celestial object is a number that is a
measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The smaller the
number, the
brighter a star appears.</p></blockquote><p>At the time I started, the most identifiable constellation was
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)>Orion</a>. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse>Betelgeuse</a>, reddish orange star in Orion, very quickly became my
favorite star. It gets the designation α Orionis even though Rigel is the
brightest star in Orion (β Orionis). Betelgeuse&rsquo;s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude>apparent magnitude</a> varies
between 0-1.3, making it at times the brightest star in Orion. The star is
huge - 630 times the radius of the sun. It was the first star (other than the
Sun) to be imaged beyond a point source.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)>Taurus</a> is another constellation that I observed in my initial stargazing
period. It extends over a large area, so not as identifiable. But it is a host
for a unique star cluster: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades>Pleiades</a>. The 5-6 bright stars in the cluster are
a singular sight with naked eyes.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major>Canis Major</a> also has a significance for me as the host for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius>Sirius</a> (the
brightest star). Its relatively close, being only about 8.6 light years away.</p><p>There were some other constellations as well, but I haven&rsquo;t paid them too much
attention. Listing some off the top of my head: Gemini, Puppis, Hydra and
Virgo. But I couldn&rsquo;t identify them without Orion / Canis Major as anchors.</p><h2 id=moon><a class=heading-anchor href=#moon aria-label="Permalink to Moon">§</a>
Moon</h2><p>Moon&rsquo;s the most noticeable and obvious site in the sky. At times, based on the
shape of the moon&rsquo;s bright portion, I&rsquo;d try to visualize how the Sun, the Moon
and the Earth are positioned relative to each other. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22%C2%B0_halo>22° halo</a> around
the moon is also nice to look at. To be honest though, I am always more
interested in the Moon&rsquo;s absence, since it impacts the visibility of stars
significantly. It also damages my eye&rsquo;s dark adjustment.</p><h2 id=planets><a class=heading-anchor href=#planets aria-label="Permalink to Planets">§</a>
Planets</h2><p>The first 6 planets are readily visible to the naked eye. Although, Earth&rsquo;s
little too close to have an astronomical perspective. Because planets are at a
distance and visible as extend objects, they don&rsquo;t twinkle. This makes it easy
to differentiate them from stars. Even <a href=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000725.html>Betelgeuse</a>
twinkles.</p><p>March this year, Jupiter was at the opposition (Earth being roughly in between
the Sun and Jupiter) and had its closest approach to us. Hence, it was at its
brightest.</p><p>Venus is always very bright (3rd brightest after the Sun and the Moon), but is
visible near the Sunrise and the Sunset (hence called the morning/evening star).</p><p>Mars and Saturn as of now are located nearby. Mars is bright reddish in color
and Saturn is yellowish in color.</p><p>22nd January 2016 was a interesting day for planet watching. The 5 planets were
<a href=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/160120-planet-parade-stargazing-astronomy/>all aligned</a> for the first time in over a decade.</p><p>The path that the Sun and the planets take also point toward the flatness of the
solar system. Feels nice to get some empirical evidence of this, against just
having this told.</p><h2 id=artificial-objects><a class=heading-anchor href=#artificial-objects aria-label="Permalink to Artificial objects">§</a>
Artificial objects</h2><p>A few artificial objects orbiting the Earth can be seen as well. For them, the
sunset happens later (or sunrise earlier) than us, providing us with the dark
background and enough contrast for the sunlight they reflect. The International
Space Station (ISS), because of its size ends up being brighter than even
Venus. <a href=https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/>This NASA&rsquo;s site</a> can be used to plan an ISS sighting.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare#Iridium_flares>Iridium</a> satellites&rsquo; flares are also noticeable at times. There are ways to
plan their sightings, but I haven&rsquo;t done that yet.</p><h2 id=limiting-magnitude-lm><a class=heading-anchor href=#limiting-magnitude-lm aria-label="Permalink to Limiting Magnitude (LM)">§</a>
Limiting Magnitude (LM)</h2><blockquote><p>In astronomy, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_magnitude>limiting magnitude</a> is the faintest apparent magnitude of a
celestial body that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.</p><ul><li>Wikipedia</li></ul></blockquote><p>I like to calculate the limiting magnitude. This would give me an idea of the
light pollution and what I should expect to see. I notice light pollution in
Pune is (unsurprisingly) more than that in Jaipur. From
<a href=http://www.imo.net/visual/major/observation/lm>these charts</a>, I calculated the LM at Pune to be about 4.5. I came
to doubt that when I eventually started using <a href=http://stellarium.org/>Stellarium</a>. The naked eye LM
at my place is roughly 3.5 - 3.8.</p><p>I should give using the charts another try. At the time, I had used the Tau
(using stars in/near Taurus) chart which has a magnitude gap of 1.62 between 3
and 4 visible stars.</p><h2 id=wonders><a class=heading-anchor href=#wonders aria-label="Permalink to Wonders">§</a>
Wonders</h2><p>Stargazing results in multiple interesting and unsettling thoughts:</p><ul><li>When I see a star, the photons hitting my eyes are 1000s of year old. For
example: Light from Betelgeuse travels for roughly 643 years to reach us.</li><li>I are literally looking at the past of those stars. But again, at these
scales, the concept of present can be doubted. Einstein talks about the <em>The
relativity of simultaneity</em> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420946331/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1420946331&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=CY4F7W7SQWMXRNIL">his book</a>.</li><li>The insignificance of the Earth&rsquo;s and us with it in the universe.</li><li>We most probably aren&rsquo;t alone.</li><li>How amazingly useful constellations are in navigating the sky.</li><li>How made up constellations are and the irrational significance humans give to
them.</li></ul><h2 id=telescope><a class=heading-anchor href=#telescope aria-label="Permalink to Telescope">§</a>
Telescope</h2><p>After a month of naked eye stargazing, I bought a telescope (similar to
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000Y8C2Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=H3RLG5OMNQX6ZMOH">this one</a> but with better eyepieces) from a local
provider. I&rsquo;ll write about my observations with that over the next few days.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Edit</strong><br>The post on my experience with a telescope has now been published
<a href=/telescope/>here</a>.</p></blockquote></article></main><footer><a href=/blog>All Posts</a>
