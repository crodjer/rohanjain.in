<div class="post">
  <p>About 6 months ago, I picked up a new hobby: Stargazing. Starting off with just naked eyes, I quickly realized that there is actually quite a lot to see without any optical equipment. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en">Sky Map</a> and <a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a> are incredibly useful applications for a dilettante like me.</p>
<h2 id="dark-adjustment">Dark adjustment</h2>
<p>Before any stargazing session, dark adjustment, i.e. dilate the pupils completely to see in dark, is essential. I turn off all kinds of lights in the house and listen to podcasts for a while (at least 30 minutes). Eventually, when that the outside looks brighter than the pitch dark inside, I go outside. Avoiding the bright lights from neighbours can be a challenge. Moon’s an issue too.</p>
<h2 id="constellations">Constellations</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> (m) of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The smaller the number, the brighter a star appears.<br />
- Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time I started, the most identifiable constellation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)">Orion</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>, reddish orange in color, very quickly became my favorite star (overall). It gets the designation α Orionis even though Rigel is the brightest star in Orion (β Orionis). Betelgeuse’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> varies between 0-1.3, making it at times the brightest star in Orion.</p>
<p>Betelgeuse is huge with 630 times the radius of the sun. It was the first star (other than the Sun) to be imaged beyond a point source.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)">Taurus</a> is another constellation that I observed in my initial stargazing period. It extends over a large area, so not as identifiable. But it is a host for a unique star cluster: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades">Pleiades</a>. The 5-6 close by bright stars is a singular sight with naked eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major">Canis Major</a> also has a significance for me as the host for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius">Sirius</a> (the brightest star). Its relatively close, being only about 8.6 light years away.</p>
<p>There were some other constellations as well, but I haven’t paid them too much attention. Listing some off the top of my head: Gemini, Puppis, Hydra and Virgo. But I couldn’t identify them without Orion / Canis Major as anchors.</p>
<h2 id="moon">Moon</h2>
<p>Moon’s the most noticeable and obvious site in the sky. At times, based on the shape of the moon’s bright portion, I’d try to visualize how the Sun, the Moon and the Earth are positioned relative to each other. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22°_halo">22° halo</a> around the moon is also nice to look at. To be honest though, I am always more interested in the Moon’s absence, since it impacts the visibility of stars significantly. It also damages my eye’s dark adjustment.</p>
<h2 id="planets">Planets</h2>
<p>The first 6 planets are readily visible to the naked eye. Although, Earth’s little too close to have an astronomical perspective. Because planets are at a distance and visible as extend objects, they don’t twinkle. This makes it easy to differentiate them from stars. Even <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000725.html">Betelgeuse</a> twinkles.</p>
<p>March this year, Jupiter was at the opposition (Earth roughly in between the Sun and Jupiter) and had its closest approach the the Earth. So, it was at its brightest.</p>
<p>Venus is always very bright (3rd brightest after the Sun and the Moon), but is visible near the Sunrise and the Sunset (hence called the morning/evening star).</p>
<p>Mars and Saturn as of now are located nearby. Mars is bright reddish in color and Saturn is yellowish in color.</p>
<p>22nd January 2016 was a interesting day for planet watching. The 5 planets were <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/160120-planet-parade-stargazing-astronomy/">all aligned</a> for the first time in over a decade.</p>
<p>The path that the Sun and the planets take also point toward the flatness of the solar system. Feels nice to get some empirical evidence of this, against just having this told.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-objects">Artificial objects</h2>
<p>A few artificial objects orbiting the Earth can be seen as well. For them, the sunset happens later (or sunrise earlier) than us, providing us with the dark background and enough contrast for the sunlight they reflect. The International Space Station (ISS), because of its size is brighter than even Venus. <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">This NASA’s site</a> can be used to plan an ISS sighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare#Iridium_flares">Iridium</a> satellites’ flares are also noticeable at times. There are ways to plan their sightings, but I haven’t done that yet.</p>
<h2 id="limiting-magnitude-lm">Limiting Magnitude (LM)</h2>
<p>Quoting Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In astronomy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_magnitude">limiting magnitude</a> is the faintest apparent magnitude of a celestial body that is detectable or detected by a given instrument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I stargazed with just the naked eye, I liked to calculate the limiting magnitude. This would give me an idea of the light pollution and what I should expect. I notice light pollution in Pune is (unsurprisingly) more than that in Jaipur. From <a href="http://www.imo.net/visual/major/observation/lm">these charts</a>, I calculated the LM to be about 4.5. I came to doubt that when I eventually started using <a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>. The naked eye LM at my place is roughly 3.5 - 3.8.</p>
<p>I should give using the charts another try. At the time, I had used the Tau (using stars in/near Taurus) chart which has a magnitude gap of 1.62 between 3 and 4 visible stars.</p>
<h2 id="telescope">Telescope</h2>
<p>After a month of naked eye stargazing, I bought a telescope (similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y8C2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000Y8C2Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=crodjer-20&amp;linkId=H3RLG5OMNQX6ZMOH">this one</a> but with better eyepieces) from a local shop. I’ll write about my observations with that over the next few days.</p>
