            <div class='post-text'>I have this internship of mine in which I am supposed to develop web applications using the Merb framework. So, how do I go about it? Isn't it simple? Install the 'gems', read the 'documentation', and start writing the 'code'. Aah.. if only the Merb community had been so kind and taken the pains to document their work. "Incredulous, ain't you?" Go to their web-site and check it out for yourself. Oh yes, they have some shit output by a program called 'rdoc' under their API section, which they proudly hail as documentation. Its good for nothing. At least not for the beginners. And especially not if you have migrated from the comforts of <span style="font-style: italic;">a very properly documented</span>, Django(its written in Python) framework. "I love you, Django guys."<br />Again, I have this other job of writing tests. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> has taken over the Ruby community like a storm. The crux is that the tool 'rspec' comes with no proper documentation. If you are moron enough to be unable to guess yet, 'rspec' is the tool meant to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> in Ruby/Merb. Poor me. :P<br /><br />Well I won't just rant about the laziness of the Ruby community, rather I am providing here some links which proved helpful to me. Maybe it helps you out as well.<br /><br /><ol><li><a href="http://book.merbist.com/">The Merb Open Source Book</a>- It is the Djangobook counterpart for Merb, only it is still incomplete. You are most welcome to contribute to it.</li><li><a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/documentation/guides">Notes from their wiki</a>- They have a bit of good notes about the framework.</li><li><a href="http://wiki.merbivore.com/howto/gettingstarted/firstapp">Your first Merb App</a>- Won't help much if you are not already aware of what it does.</li></ol><br />Another thing is learning the TDD. You simply cannot do anything without reading at least one of these two:-<br /><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-rspec/"><br /></a><ol><li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-rspec/">Behaviour Driven Development</a>- A tutorial by IBM</li><li><a href="http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/blog/developing-a-rails-model-using-bdd-and-rspec-part-1.html">By Luke Redpath</a></li></ol><br />P.S: If you want to learn Ruby, do not go for anything other than <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/">The Pragmatic Programmers Guide</a>

            <div class='post-text'>What is web development or web programming? Is it just HTML/CSS? No. Add Javascript to that. Is that it? No. Aah, you missed out PHP. So, does that fill-in the gap. The answer still is, NO.<br /><br />Quoting directly from Wikipedia:<br /><blockquote><b>Web development</b> is a broad term for any activity related to developing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site" title="Web site" class="mw-redirect">web site</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet" title="Intranet">intranet</a>. This can include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce" title="E-commerce" class="mw-redirect">e-commerce</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_development" title="Business development">business development</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design" title="Web design">web design</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_development" title="Web content development" class="mw-redirect">web content development</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting" title="Client-side scripting">client-side</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting" title="Server-side scripting">server-side</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming" title="Programming" class="mw-redirect">scripting</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" title="Web server">web server</a> configuration. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers only to the non-design aspects of building web sites, e.g. writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" title="Markup language">markup</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">coding</a>. Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text" title="Plain text">plain text</a> to the most complex web-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_application" title="Internet application" class="mw-redirect">internet applications</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_business" title="Electronic business">electronic businesses</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service" title="Social network service">social network services</a>.</blockquote><br />Here is what you need to understand and learn. Any website is made up of three parts:<br /><ol><li>The Data Layer - All the data/information relevant to your site is ultimately stored in a Database. Say, for a stock exchange website, the data is the name of the companies, the current value of the stocks, the previous values of the stocks and so on.</li><li>The User Interface Layer - This is your point of interaction with the user, where you collect data from him or present him with some data. For example you could display a form for registering users on your site or collecting some feedback, or, the stock exchange site showing you the results of your query.<br /></li><li>The Controller Layer - It is the pathway for your data to pass from the Data Layer to the User Interface layer and vice versa. This is where you perform queries to your database. Take the stock exchange site again for example. When you query for a company name say Reliance. So what you do is obtain the search term from the user (read passing the data from), query the database and display the result (read pass on the information to the user interface layer).</li></ol>Ever since I was selected for the web team of Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur, people have haunted me with the question "What exactly is web programming?" As a matter of fact even I was unsure of it at the time I was inducted in the group. Then began our (myself and Sid) training. Artagnon was respnsible for ittrained Myself and Sid.Indeed, this post tries to answer them. This will also serve as a one stop guide to anyone who is uninitiated to this field<br />

            <div class='post-text'>Following is the institute's press release of the event quoted directly from <a href="http://scholarsavenue.blogspot.com/2009/03/institutes-press-release.html">Scholars' Avenue</a>:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote>Rohit Kumar, a third year student of IIT Kharagpur, was regularly visiting the institute hospital since the last three days on account of chronic headaches. On his way back to the hostel on the third day he fainted and fell off a cycle rickshaw and sustained serious injuries.He was again rushed to the hospital, upon which it was decided that he should be taken to Kolkata. However, on the way, his situation deteriorated and he was instead taken to Midnapore, where he was unfortunately declared brought dead.<br /><br />This incident triggered off strong emotive response from the students as they felt that the medical facilities were inadequate. The students immediately met the authorities and lodged their strong protest. The institute has expressed its condolences to Rohit’s family and friends. The administration took note of the issues and met the student general body and assured them and laid out a plan in which they would work together with the students towards improving on campus medical facilities.</blockquote><br /></span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span>This article bears testimony to the fact that the institute authorities are still not accepting their mistake. They don't feel sorry for the loss. The don't have any answer to their lousy way of working.  No apologies for their callous remarks.<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /><br /></span></span>Maybe I was stupid to expect from the institute a true picture of the story in its press release. There still is no mention of<span style="font-style: italic;">:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></span><ol><li>delay in providing medicinal facilities</li><li>incompetent doctors and staff</li><li>lack of emergency facilities</li><li>the ambulance incident</li></ol>And yes, why would they? Who wants to pronounce himself as a criminal?<br /><br />Will the institute ever come out of its corrupt way of working? Or, should I put it like this "Can it become free from <span style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> control of the Government (yes, I am referring, <span style="font-style: italic;">especially</span> to the bungling HR ministry)?"

            <div class='post-text'>This Sunday, the 22nd of March, shall go down as a black day in the<br />history of IIT, Kharagpur. It was with great sadness and considerable<br />anger that the residents of the campus received news of the demise of<br />one of its own; third year Electrical Engineering student, Rohit<br />Kumar. A resident of the LLR Hall of Residence, Rohit had been<br />visiting the hospital since Friday, the 20th of March, complaining of<br />headaches. On Sunday, the headaches became increasingly painful and it<br />was on his way back from the doctor that he fainted and fell from the<br />rickshaw, resulting in major injuries. Following this, he was taken to<br />BC Roy hospital by two students of LLR. The doctor on duty (who was<br />present at the time when Rohit was taken to the hospital), Dr. N.K.<br />Som, recommended that he be taken to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata and<br />shown to a neurosurgeon. He stated that BC Roy did not have facilities<br />to handle such cases and that it was best to take him to Kolkata as<br />soon as possible. However, problems (such as filling of petrol) and<br />the extensive paperwork involved in arranging an ambulance caused a<br />delay of 2 hours during the course of which nothing much could be<br />done.<br /><br />He was finally sent on his way to Kolkata with 2 students for company<br />and an untrained attendant. En route it was realized that though the<br />oxygen mask had been placed over his mouth, the tank had still not<br />been turned on. Soon after this, Rohit started coughing up blood. The<br />students who accompanied him had the attendant call up Dr. Som and the<br />students followed his instructions; pumping out blood without any help<br />from the attendant. At the time, it was decided to take Rohit to the<br />Spandan Hospital in Midnapore since his condition was deteriorating<br />rapidly. In spite of asking the BC Roy officials to call ahead and<br />inform Spandan of the impending arrival, there was no one there to<br />receive them. By the time a doctor was found, Rohit had passed away<br />and the hospital declared him dead on arrival. At present, his body<br />lies in the mortuary at Midnapore medical college.<br /><br />This isn't a one time instance. The dismal state of affairs at BC Roy Technology Hospital has been an issue of concern for ages now. Complaints of incorrect diagnosis and lack of medical equipment to attend to emergencies have been rampant for decades.<br /><br />The foundation stone for a super-specialty hospital was laid by Dr. A<br />P J Abdul Kalam, on one of these visits to the campus as the President<br />of India. However, the project has been put on hold, for reasons unstated.<br /><br />This year, a fresh move to better interaction between students and<br />administration has been the initiation of Open House Discussions.<br />Students strongly voiced their need for better medical attention in<br />case of emergencies in both of such interactions held till date.<br />In response to every single instance of a BC Roy screw-up has been a<br />"We will look into it." All false promises.<br /><br />This unfortunate demise of our friend saw the epitome of it all. Patience snapped and pursuance adopted a new stance.<br /><br />All the students gathered outside the Director's Bungalow, demanding<br />an explanation for turning a deaf ear to our pleas in the past. His vague"we'll look into it" and the insensitive "It's no big deal" ignited our temper. The peaceful protest took a violent shade as students chanted for his<br />resignation.<br /><br />It is rather disheartening to note that our revolution for survival has been portrayed as an ugly act of vandalism. We have been tagged hooligans in most of your leading newspapers, and all for demanding the Director to take moral responsibility and resign from his post.<br /><br /><br />We lost a comrade, we lost a friend. He died in his teens ... and it wasn't just the injury that killed him.<br /><br />We are not the vandals and hooligans as portrayed by the media to the<br />world beyond the campus. We are students, seeking a better life.<br /><br /><br />This post is attempt of the student's of IIT Kharagpur to get to the world, the true story.<br /><br />In memory of Rohit-<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/SceqlojE-3I/AAAAAAAAADg/NaS8Xp3TvYM/s1600-h/candlelight-vigil-2-150x150.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/SceqlojE-3I/AAAAAAAAADg/NaS8Xp3TvYM/s200/candlelight-vigil-2-150x150.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316405448650586994" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/ScesHL2DXhI/AAAAAAAAADo/xf0uo1ywoC4/s1600-h/candle-vigil.jpeg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 134px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/ScesHL2DXhI/AAAAAAAAADo/xf0uo1ywoC4/s200/candle-vigil.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316407124572724754" border="0" /></a><br />Read the <a href="http://scholarsavenue.blogspot.com/">minutes of the student-professor meeting</a> called today morning to address the issues.
