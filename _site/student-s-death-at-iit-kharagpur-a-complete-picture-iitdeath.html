            <h2 class='post-title'>Student's Death at IIT Kharagpur- A Complete Picture #iitdeath</h2>
            <div class='post-text'>This Sunday, the 22nd of March, shall go down as a black day in the<br />history of IIT, Kharagpur. It was with great sadness and considerable<br />anger that the residents of the campus received news of the demise of<br />one of its own; third year Electrical Engineering student, Rohit<br />Kumar. A resident of the LLR Hall of Residence, Rohit had been<br />visiting the hospital since Friday, the 20th of March, complaining of<br />headaches. On Sunday, the headaches became increasingly painful and it<br />was on his way back from the doctor that he fainted and fell from the<br />rickshaw, resulting in major injuries. Following this, he was taken to<br />BC Roy hospital by two students of LLR. The doctor on duty (who was<br />present at the time when Rohit was taken to the hospital), Dr. N.K.<br />Som, recommended that he be taken to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata and<br />shown to a neurosurgeon. He stated that BC Roy did not have facilities<br />to handle such cases and that it was best to take him to Kolkata as<br />soon as possible. However, problems (such as filling of petrol) and<br />the extensive paperwork involved in arranging an ambulance caused a<br />delay of 2 hours during the course of which nothing much could be<br />done.<br /><br />He was finally sent on his way to Kolkata with 2 students for company<br />and an untrained attendant. En route it was realized that though the<br />oxygen mask had been placed over his mouth, the tank had still not<br />been turned on. Soon after this, Rohit started coughing up blood. The<br />students who accompanied him had the attendant call up Dr. Som and the<br />students followed his instructions; pumping out blood without any help<br />from the attendant. At the time, it was decided to take Rohit to the<br />Spandan Hospital in Midnapore since his condition was deteriorating<br />rapidly. In spite of asking the BC Roy officials to call ahead and<br />inform Spandan of the impending arrival, there was no one there to<br />receive them. By the time a doctor was found, Rohit had passed away<br />and the hospital declared him dead on arrival. At present, his body<br />lies in the mortuary at Midnapore medical college.<br /><br />This isn't a one time instance. The dismal state of affairs at BC Roy Technology Hospital has been an issue of concern for ages now. Complaints of incorrect diagnosis and lack of medical equipment to attend to emergencies have been rampant for decades.<br /><br />The foundation stone for a super-specialty hospital was laid by Dr. A<br />P J Abdul Kalam, on one of these visits to the campus as the President<br />of India. However, the project has been put on hold, for reasons unstated.<br /><br />This year, a fresh move to better interaction between students and<br />administration has been the initiation of Open House Discussions.<br />Students strongly voiced their need for better medical attention in<br />case of emergencies in both of such interactions held till date.<br />In response to every single instance of a BC Roy screw-up has been a<br />"We will look into it." All false promises.<br /><br />This unfortunate demise of our friend saw the epitome of it all. Patience snapped and pursuance adopted a new stance.<br /><br />All the students gathered outside the Director's Bungalow, demanding<br />an explanation for turning a deaf ear to our pleas in the past. His vague"we'll look into it" and the insensitive "It's no big deal" ignited our temper. The peaceful protest took a violent shade as students chanted for his<br />resignation.<br /><br />It is rather disheartening to note that our revolution for survival has been portrayed as an ugly act of vandalism. We have been tagged hooligans in most of your leading newspapers, and all for demanding the Director to take moral responsibility and resign from his post.<br /><br /><br />We lost a comrade, we lost a friend. He died in his teens ... and it wasn't just the injury that killed him.<br /><br />We are not the vandals and hooligans as portrayed by the media to the<br />world beyond the campus. We are students, seeking a better life.<br /><br /><br />This post is attempt of the student's of IIT Kharagpur to get to the world, the true story.<br /><br />In memory of Rohit-<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/SceqlojE-3I/AAAAAAAAADg/NaS8Xp3TvYM/s1600-h/candlelight-vigil-2-150x150.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/SceqlojE-3I/AAAAAAAAADg/NaS8Xp3TvYM/s200/candlelight-vigil-2-150x150.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316405448650586994" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/ScesHL2DXhI/AAAAAAAAADo/xf0uo1ywoC4/s1600-h/candle-vigil.jpeg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 134px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uEnvaxJViA4/ScesHL2DXhI/AAAAAAAAADo/xf0uo1ywoC4/s200/candle-vigil.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316407124572724754" border="0" /></a><br />Read the <a href="http://scholarsavenue.blogspot.com/">minutes of the student-professor meeting</a> called today morning to address the issues.
