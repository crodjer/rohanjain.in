            <h2 class='post-title'>E4SI Fellowship</h2>
            <div class='post-text'>How I came to know about E4SI was through Shrey Goyal, a 2008 fellow. Though the words "Social Impact" stirred excitement in me I was very unsure of the nature of the work. Intellecap offered me the opportunity to work at the intersection of Technology and Social Sector. Through E4SI I got the opportunity to work for a 'real' project. I got the opportunity to work with the 'professionals'. What could be a better platform to learn? E4SI gave me the chance to meet the change makers.<br /><br />I was instantly comfortable with Intellecap's working environment. I was to stay at the company's guest house. A jogging park, mall, gym and lot of restraunts and snakcs corners were nearby. A fifteen minutes walk, straight from the guest house, led to my office.<br /><br />4th May, was the first day of my office. I was to work with the Tech Team (also called the Geek Team by co-workers) under Siddharth (Sid). Office hours for me where anything from twelve in the afternoon to eight thirty in the evening. To Sid what ultimately mattered was my motivation to work and my productivity.<br /><br />My first job was to write Tests for MISFIT (our MIS for the MFIs). The aim was to get aquainted with the existing codebase, and the tool and the technologies used. The working platform was GNU/Linux with Ruby for scripting and Merb/Rails for web programming.  My major project was to develop, a KMS (Knowledge Mangement System) for SMEs ( Small Medium Buisness). The software essentially is an easy to use, feature rich "Office Twitter", with the ability to create group updates, create private messages, comment on updates, attach multiple files along with the update, tag the update, create  and moderate polls and groups and perform full text searches. Alongside, I also devloped scripts to audit loans for the MFIs that migrated to MISFIT from their older solution. Later, I also worked on improving, and demonstrating the web API of MISFIT to potential clients for easy integration with their legacy system.<br /><br />Very soon I mixed with the highly skilled team that drives Intellecap. Lunch time was my slot for interaction with the entire Intellecap team, where they would share their experiences on work and life. Friday afternoons were always dedicated to watching an episode of TED talk, which would invariably invite a heated discussion.<br /><br />This was my first opportunity to work at a professional level. I made a product that brings to the enterprises the power of the Internet to share "information" within any company in real time and, manage "work". Thanks to Intellecap and E4SI at having provided me with a summer that was filled with loads of fun and adventure.
