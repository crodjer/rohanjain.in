            <h2 class='post-title'>IIT Kharagpur's Press Relase #iitdeath</h2>
            <div class='post-text'>Following is the institute's press release of the event quoted directly from <a href="http://scholarsavenue.blogspot.com/2009/03/institutes-press-release.html">Scholars' Avenue</a>:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote>Rohit Kumar, a third year student of IIT Kharagpur, was regularly visiting the institute hospital since the last three days on account of chronic headaches. On his way back to the hostel on the third day he fainted and fell off a cycle rickshaw and sustained serious injuries.He was again rushed to the hospital, upon which it was decided that he should be taken to Kolkata. However, on the way, his situation deteriorated and he was instead taken to Midnapore, where he was unfortunately declared brought dead.<br /><br />This incident triggered off strong emotive response from the students as they felt that the medical facilities were inadequate. The students immediately met the authorities and lodged their strong protest. The institute has expressed its condolences to Rohitâ€™s family and friends. The administration took note of the issues and met the student general body and assured them and laid out a plan in which they would work together with the students towards improving on campus medical facilities.</blockquote><br /></span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span>This article bears testimony to the fact that the institute authorities are still not accepting their mistake. They don't feel sorry for the loss. The don't have any answer to their lousy way of working.  No apologies for their callous remarks.<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /><br /></span></span>Maybe I was stupid to expect from the institute a true picture of the story in its press release. There still is no mention of<span style="font-style: italic;">:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></span><ol><li>delay in providing medicinal facilities</li><li>incompetent doctors and staff</li><li>lack of emergency facilities</li><li>the ambulance incident</li></ol>And yes, why would they? Who wants to pronounce himself as a criminal?<br /><br />Will the institute ever come out of its corrupt way of working? Or, should I put it like this "Can it become free from <span style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> control of the Government (yes, I am referring, <span style="font-style: italic;">especially</span> to the bungling HR ministry)?"
