            <div class='post-text'><p><br />Few of my friends recently raised the concern that 'I am heading towards geekdom and that I am not being as cool as they are'. So one day I had to lend my unwilling ears to their 'grand lecture' on portraying oneself as 'a cool dude'. The lesson culminated into a fight over "Metal vs. Hip Hop","Gyming vs. Sports", "Long Hairs vs. Short Hairs". And the docile pupil learnt his first lesson, "You have to be different." Wow! Brilliant eh! I dedicate this post to those peers of mine.<br /><br />Well, here comes links of some really cool pics.<br /><ol><li><a href="http://damncoolpics.blogspot.com/2009/02/crazy-bikes.html">A collection of really weird and unusual bikes from around the world.</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.nataliedee.com/042406/as-long-as-you-dont-swing-around-it-will-be-cool.jpg">As long as you don't swing around!</a></li><br /></ol><br /></p>

            <div class='post-text'><p>Well, the first question that comes to mind after getting a hang of the 'almighty VIM' is "Is there a way to swap 'esc' key with something near the home row?".Aye! there is. Swap the 'esc' and 'caps lock' key. Here is how:<br /><ol><li>Fire up Vim to create an (say 'keymap') ASCII plain text file (<code>vim keymap</code>) with the content:<br /><code>remove Lock = Caps_Lock<br />keysym Escape = Caps_Lock<br />keysym Caps_Lock = Escape<br />add Lock = Caps_Lock<code></li><br /><li>now execute the command:<br /><code>xmodmap "filename"</code>, obviously without the quotes, and you are done.</li></ol><br />The above applies to all distros of linux. Personally I have tested it on Debian. And yes, the change is global.<br /></p>

            <div class='post-text'>A bad start of the week. Bunked all the classes on Monday and yet did nothing. A bit of twittering, a little Django, and then planning, what to do the next day. I hate being unproductive. A very bad pain in the ear kept me unproductively awake till 3 am. Tuesday. I wasn't prepared for my viva on Physic's practical. Luckily!the choice of giving a viva is vested in the students. Again, I couldn't complete the Forced Oscillation experiment. Finally a PDS lab in the afternoon. Ah! Damn me! I wrote a bad merge sort algorithm. Spent the evening debugging C programs for my friend and teaching them (today is PDS test). Preparing for a submission in Mechanics took the rest part of the night. And now (Wednesday morning), i am writing this post. Today the only good thing to look forward to is, the Artagnon meet.<br /><br />Well, good night world. And, best of luck to me.

Every profile in firefox has its own preferences and memory allocation (i.e. cookies, password, history). The following applies to Firefox on Linux. I have especially tried it on Debian with Iceweasel installed (my system obviously), but it should work for all distros as well.</p> <p> <ol><li>1.Open the terminal and type in:<br /><code>firefox -ProfileManager</code><br />this opens Profile Manager of Firefox, where you can create a new profile or rename or delete an exsting profile. A profile named “default” will be pre-existent.</li><li>2.Create a new profile, select it and click “Start Firefox”. Configure all your settings.</li><li>3.Again whenever you want to start Firefox with the new profile you created type the following in the terminal:<br /><code>firefox</code> -P (profile name) , without the parentheses</li></ol></p> <p>Debian users can replace “firefox” with “iceweasel” wherever you need to type-in the commands, but “firefox” will work equally well.</p></div>
